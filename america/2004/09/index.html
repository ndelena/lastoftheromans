            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/roy_davis.jpg" alt="Roy Davis" align="left" hspace="4">In yet another example of the injustices inherent in our corporate interests-dominated healthcare industry, the BBC News' latest Photo journal titled "America's uninsured" features a story about Defannie Davis, whose husband Roy suffered a massive stroke in 2002, as a result of not being able to afford his blood pressure medication. After his stroke, his kidneys failed, he contracted pneumonia and he was in a coma for three days. He's now unable to speak at all and is undergoing various forms of therapy. After his initial stroke he suffered another one, and a heart attack. Only after incurring immense medical expenses did Medicaid kick in. We are not told what the Davis family owes in outstanding medical costs... we're only told that one bill alone was over $26,000. Under Medicaid, the Davis family only pays $1 for their medication. Roy Davis must undergo dialysis three time a week and has developed numerous infections as a result of the dialysis procedure. </p>

<p>It is a journal that seems to touch upon the overwhelming inhumanity and irony of 45 million Americans going uninsured - in the "wealthiest" nation on earth. Our current system demands the poor be poorer before it will offer assistance. In both my stays in the U.K. and Spain all health care and medication was freely available (even to me). To the European viewers of the photo journal, the Davis' story must seem barbaric. And it is.</p>

            <p>At midnight tonight, September 13, 2004, the 1994 Brady Bill banning assault weapons will expire. In just seven hours from the time of this post, AK-47s, UZIs, TEC-9s, flash suppressors and bayonetted rifles will all be perfectly legal from Maine to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>President Bush, who claims he supports an extension of the ban, has not urged Congress to extend it, instead coming out in criticism of John Kerry, who recently advocated for the ban's extension.</p>

<p>Here are some images of the weapons that will soon be legal:</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g4ar15.jpg" alt="AR-15" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AR-15</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g5aug.jpg" alt="Steyr AUG" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steyr AUG</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g6striker.jpg" alt="Striker 12" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Striker 12</p>

<p>The last one is a particularly lethal shotgun known as the Striker 12; the round barrel underneath is a revolving chamber, making the gun automatic firing. Yes, an automatic shotgun.</p>

<p>In gathering research about the bill, I found a site called <a href="http://www.awbansunset.com">AWbansunset</a>. Their motto is "Fighting for the expiration of the '94 "Assault Weapons" Ban!" </p>

<p>They have a link titled "Why Would Anyone Want to Own [an assault weapon]?" in which they say: "There are many answers to that question. Itís kind of like asking a car enthusiast why they would ever want to own a 425 horsepower 1968 Corvette Stingray. There are many reasons, some objective, some emotional. All of them legitimate, at least to the driver."</p>

<p>I realize that both a 1968 Corvette and an AK-105 automatic machine gun can easily kill a crowd of people, but at least the former was designed for an alternate purpose.</p>

<p>They continue to say that military rifles are "easy to operate", "reliable", "fun to shoot" and "very accurate." The lynchpin of their argument is in "personal defense" matters. I could not paraphrase it more to fit my argument, so I will quote it directly:</p>

<p><i>With the right type of ammunition, military style rifles can be a very effective defensive weapon. Many police agencies have recognized their value and have adopted their use in close quarter tactical operations. In these post 9/11 days, prudent Americans recognize that we are all vulnerable and should be prepared to defend ourselves, our families, our communities, and our country from threats that can strike us anytime and anyplace. A well-trained person, armed with a military style rifle can provide a deterrent and, if necessary, an effective defense. Full capacity magazines, whether for rifles or pistols, are also very important in this role, particularly in a situation where a homeowner finds him/herself facing multiple attackers.</i></p>

<p>Are people really that paranoid? Regardless, their argument that police forces have adopted these types of weapons does not hold water. In 1997, police in a North Hollywood, CA, shootout with <b>two</b> men had to pull back, because the men were armed with assault weapons. After the event, Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police said: "<i>An AK-47 fires a military round. In a conventional home with dry-wall walls, I wouldn't be surprised if it went through six of them...Police are armed with weapons that are effective with criminals in line of sight. They don't want and don't need weapons that would harm innocent bystanders.</i>" It's that simple.</p>

<p>Also, one of the most notorious uses of assault weapons was the 1993 Branch-Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas. According to a federal affadavit, Davidians had amassed 123 AR-15s, 44 AK-47s, 2 Barrett .50 calibers, 2 Street Sweepers, an unknown number of MAC-10 and MAC-11s, 20 100-round drum magazines, and 260 large-capacity banana clips. "The weapons were bought legally from gun dealers and at gun shows." 74 men, women and children died.</p>

<p>I don't understand why this is even an issue. The 1994 ban should have been made permanent, without a sunset clause. No hunter needs an assault weapon to kill an animal. (Arguably, no hunter needs to hunt either. I hear sup<br />
ermarkets are well stocked these days.)</p>

<p>This is a shame.</p>

            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/images/letter-t.gif" align="left" hspace="1">hree years ago, I sat on the subway at Wonderland station, waiting for the train to leave. It was my junior year of college and I was late for a marketing class. It was early but warm and I was groggy and disgruntled as usual. Typically the train waits for no more than five minutes, but this particular morning I sat for fifteen or twenty minutes. The driver came on and said that downtown service had been suspended. He ran out of the front of the car and into the station chief's office. I caught a glimpse of three people inside huddled around a television before the door shut. </p>

<p>I drove back home to find three messages on my answering machine from Tom. The first one was just to say that something bizarre happened and a plane hit the World Trade Center. I figured it was a small propellered plane horribly off course or in danger. The second message was markedly more frantic, as the second plane hit. I hit stop before the message finished, grabbed my phone and turned the television on. I was on the phone with Tom for a few hours - we were both silent; watching the television in shock. They broke from New York to Washington as Peter Jennings on ABC first reported smoke sighted and I remember my first thought was if Boston would be next.</p>

<p>My house is only about four miles from Logan airport in Boston, and my neighborhood is below the flight path for two or three of the runways. There's always the remote sound or sight of an airplane somewhere. That afternoon, for the first time, I went outside and down to the beach at the end of the street and heard nothing. There was no activity at the airport and the skies were blue and quiet. I sat there for an hour or so, and soon saw two F-15 fighter jets scream along the ocean heading south and turning over Boston. It seemed quite unnatural to see our military on duty- at home. For the next three days the F-15s were the only objects in the sky, steely gray and reflective in the sunlight.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, America had a historic opportunity to take the world's unity to heart and fight a "war on terror" with hundreds of allies and trillions of dollars in resources - and with billions of people behind the cause. This strategy was renounced quickly, with the administration instead opting for a rally-behind-the-dictator style war frenzy. Osama was the objective, then he was not. al-Qaeda was the objective, then it was not. Afghanistan was the battleground, then it was forgotten. Now we're embroiled in an Iraqi occupation with hundreds of thousands of troops and hundreds of billions of tax dollars. And now there's talk of Syria and Iran being next. </p>

<p>Yes, it is three years later. </p>

<p>And what do we see? A slipping, a loss of control, a distortion in the world's balance. Allies renounced, American military bases spanning massive swaths of formerly Soviet territory, cutting into previously unknowable countries such as Kyrgizstan and Tajikistan. </p>

<p>An administration eager to Americanize Iraq, at the cost of 1,000+ American lives (over 7,000 injured), and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives. An administration that chooses an imperial war and turns its back on legitimate humanitarian crises as the one occuring in Darfur. </p>

<p>The USA Patriot Act shoved through congress overnight, allowing government searches without warrants. Detentions without due process. A complete disregard for habeas corpus.</p>

<p>The neo-conservatives have won the civil war in the Republican party. The old fiscal conservatives who were reluctant to send the military anywhere are dead and gone. We now witness the party of the zealous evangelicals bent on simplifying a complex world. They are actively fighting to undermine diversity and harmony at home and hasten an ideological reshaping of the world in their own narrow and distorted image. They spend deeply into deficit, while distributing subsidies to the wealthiest 1%. Their Iraq experiment has gone horribly awry; pushing moderate, reform-minded Arabs into anti-American positions, undermining democratic reforms in Syria, Iran and Egypt, sending a message to the world that the United States is not interested in home-grown democracy, but in "Made in the USA"-branded socio-corporatism on the sharp end of a bayonet.</p>

<p>We've now given our once-No.1 enemy (al-Qaeda, remember them?) a historic opportunity to massacre as many American soldiers as they can in Iraq, as our troops are kept there longer and longer, as retired military personnel are called back, as soldiers are denied leave and not told when they'll return home to their loved ones. (As Donald Rumsfeld realizes American military might is finite.)</p>

<p>We see the politicization of our national tragedy at the Republican National Convention. We see 3,000 people - Americans, Brits, Australians, Indians, Christians, Athiests, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, like you or I who lost their lives simply by going to work made into fear-driven stump speeches. When our heart-attack prone bleeding from the mouth Vice President tells the country ""It's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on Nov. 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States." - vote George Bush or die.</p>

<p>Ours is an America hijacked, careening down a dead-end mountain road of cliff-edges. We need to wrest control of the emergency brake and take back our democracy, not just for ourselves, but for the world.</p>

<p>France's <b>Liberation</b> - editorial: <i>Since 11 September 2001, terrorism has been the basic parameter of international politics... The military and police response is necessary and the networks inspired by Bin Laden have fortunately taken as many blows as they have delivered. But al-Qaeda has not disappeared, and the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq is playing into the hands of the jihadists. The war against Islamo-terrorism... cannot be won by the force of American arms alone, as is proved by each day that passes in Iraq.</i></p>

<p>Germany's <b>Der Tagesspiegel</b> - commentary by Harald Martenstein: <i>The terrorists' driving force was hatred... hatred of freedom. What has happened since then? In the USA the patriot act has restricted civil liberties; a detention centre was built that is a mockery of democr<br />
atic principles, and a war was begun on grounds that before 11 September no one would have accepted... Fear is useful. But it must not make us blind or hysterical. The world has become less free since 11 September 2001; that is unfortunately a victory for the terrorists.</i></p>

<p>Spain's <b>El Pais</b> - editorial headlined "Getting worse": <i>9/11 aroused a wave of sympathy and European solidarity for the United States, which Bush not only did not know how to take advantage of, but scorned. Three years later, precisely because of Iraq, the transatlantic breach has grown in a worrying way.</i></p>

<p>Pakistan's <b>Dawn</b> - editorial: <i>The 9/11 tragedy has all but been pushed into the background by the mayhem that has been let loose in Iraq and the blundering pursuit of an illegal war. The images from Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib have overtaken the shattering images of the Twin Towers... It is time for everyone to pause and take a deep breath and go back to the drawing board. A far greater reliance on political methods and better intelligence gathering seems the only alternative to the present total and counter-productive dependence on brute force.</i></p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's <b>Al-Riyadh</b> - editorial: <i>The trouble with Bush is that he put America's honour above everything and regarded 11 September as a cue for the USA to behave in a way that would guarantee its position as the undisputed superpower, taking decisions regardless of its acceptance or rejection by friends and allies.</i></p>

<p>And lastly a very thoughtful and gentile editorial from Japan's <b>Asahi Shimbun</b>: <i>Two virtues of the American people are the courage to sacrifice oneself and the admiration of self-sacrifice. In the world of international politics, the United States has the strength to endure sacrifice for the benefit of attaining the goal. That is exactly why we want the Americans to know that the use of force requires wisdom. We want the United States to characterise itself as part of a diverse and multi-polar world by overcoming the narrow values of unilateralism. Washington should pay attention to the negative sides of globalisation as well and thus try to eradicate the breeding grounds of terrorism.</i></p>

<p>In the flood of reporting following that warm September day, I heard one commentator say that the United States was "the world's best hope for ordinary days." I believed it then, and even after three years of chaos, war and decline I still believe it.</p>

<p>"<i>When it went off, in the New Mexico dawn, that first atomic bomb, we thought of Alfred Nobel, and his hope, his vain hope, that dynamite would put an end to wars. We thought of the legend of Prometheus, of that deep sense of guilt in man's new powers, that reflects his recognition of evil, and  his long knowledge of it. We knew that it was a new world,  but even more we knew that novelty itself was a very old thing in human life, that all our ways are rooted in it.</i> - J. Robert Oppenheimer</p>
