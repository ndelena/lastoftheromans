        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>In ancient Rome, Julius Caesar's sovereignty was embraced by the majority of Roman subjects. After decades of civil war, culminating in the assassination and defeat of Pompey, Caesar became sole ruler of the Mediterranean world. </p>

<p>Roman culture had long despised despotism. As legend goes, there were seven kings in early Rome. The last king, Tarquinius Superbus ("Tarquin the proud"), was expelled from Rome and the Republic founded in 509 BC. Since those early days, anyone of great power was viewed with suspicion and mistrust and the senate typically aligned itself in opposition, most usually through bloodshed. But after years of civil war, Romans had grown tired of politics; they had become sick of the chaos of war and wanted nothing but a prosperous peace, regardless of its preconditions. </p>

<p>Thus Caesar's (and later Octavian's) accession was largely embraced.</p>

<p>Modern America may seem at first entirely incomparable, but I believe we are adrift along the same indolent course. </p>

<p>In the spring 2003 print of Free Inquiry magazine, Lawrence W. Britt wrote a column titled "Fascism Anyone?" in which he outlines the 14 most common traits of fascist dictatorships. </p>

<p>"Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism, disdain for the importance of human rights, identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause, the supremacy of the military/avid militarism, rampant sexism, a controlled mass media, obsession with national security, religion and the ruling elite tied together, power of corporations protected, power of labor suppressed or eliminated, disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts, obsession with crime and punishment, rampant cronyism and corruption, and fraudulent elections." </p>

<p>It is easy to match these traits to Hitler's Germany, Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal and Pinochet's Chile. But what is more disturbing is the prevalence of these traits in our democratic republic. </p>

<p>In ancient Rome, religion was used mainly as a political tool, and quite obviously so. When the empire would annex a region, the senate would vote to make the victorious emperor the deity of the subjugated province. </p>

<p>Men were also appointed to positions in the pontifices and augustales through patronage and cronyism. These positions were quite influential (and mostly undeserved). </p>

<p>In America today we see the power of religion and its shadowy grasp on our constitution. We also see a massively overwhelming, all-powerful military and we see its place up high on a pedestal, peer in tandem only to the American corporation. </p>

<p>We are on a very disconcerting path. As this war in Iraq has proven, the United States is entirely unrivaled in the world militarily and economically, as Rome was in antiquity. We have demonstrated an uncanny ability to defy world opinion; to act against the wishes of billions of people with little or no immediate consequence. We truly are on the cusp of a historic moment for our nation, be it a positive or negative implication. What is needed now is the suspicion, the watchful eye, and the critical examination.</p>

<p>The commonly accepted notion best phrased by John Updike is ultimately a dangerous belief: "That's one of my goddamn precious American rights, not to think about politics." </p>

<p>We have seen from the Roman example what happens when a people leave politics: tyranny reigns.</p>

<p>And of this Augustus George Bush? A quote from historian Edward Gibbon comes to mind, from his book "History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire": "Trajan was ambitious of fame; and as long as mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors, the thirst of military glory will ever be the vice of the most exalted characters."</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>During my years at Suffolk, I cannot recall seeing anything like the Student Government Association meeting on March 11. Suffolk University Students for Peace and Justice sponsored a resolution condemning military action in Iraq. </p>

<p>After a delay which sent the resolution to the judiciary review board, it was finally up for debate and a vote on whether to pass it. It passed 8-7-1.</p>

<p>The seating at the event was partitioned. Non-SGA members of contrasting viewpoints were stacked opposite each other, like risers filled with antagonistic and irate parents attending their child's sporting event. Each side was given a chance to voice their opinions and did so in principle. </p>

<p>To their credit, I feel SGA essentially handled the matter appropriately. While some of us in attendance were uncertain whether or not those voting actually knew what a "yea" or "nay" would implicate, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the aggregate consensus was in favor of passing this resolution.</p>

<p>What I find motivating about the event is that it typifies the potential of a simple democratic process. Rob Laurent and those in SUSPJ put their heart and soul into this resolution and to see it pass first hand was a privilege and a testament to their dedication.</p>

<p>At one point a motion was made to establish a committee to investigate student sentiment. Thankfully, it was defeated. That would have represented an unnecessary delay that - as we see now with the war already started - would have unfairly placed the resolution up for debate after the war had already begun.</p>

<p>Those on S<br />
GA who wanted to delay the vote because they did not know the sentiment of their own constituents seemed to be asleep in their chairs: not only did they have ten days with the resolution in front of them, but they've had all year to talk to the students they represent. </p>

<p>For those members to say they do not know how the student body feels is symptomatic of a larger problem, only part of which is student apathy.</p>

<p>The same could be said for those who felt that SGA had no right to take a stand either way. It was very early on in the meeting when Vice President Dave Rodrigues stated that SGA does have the constitutional right to pass resolutions of this type. </p>

<p>Perhaps these people would rather see SGA remain an organization that does nothing but approve budgets. </p>

<p>If that is so, we could just replace everyone with one inexpensive computer, which would only need to be operated by one person, instead of an entire student government. Maybe this action would lower our activities fees over the long-term. </p>

<p>I was outraged by freshman Kristin Powers' speech and the assertion she made that to be against this war is to be against democracy and against our soldiers stationed in the Gulf and operating in Iraq. I have been thinking for days as to how one can arrive at this - she obviously displays no cognitive abilities. What could be better for the troops than bringing them home? They are fighting for our supremacy, hegemony and "strategic interests" in securing that slippery black substance known as oil. </p>

<p>That Iraq's current government has to be removed is not the point of our mission there. Perhaps if she started reading about the history of her nation she would see a pattern developing. It is people like Powers that prevent real progress from being made. They refuse to believe that our government would do anything wrong and with their tax dollars they give blind complicity.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Several Fridays ago, I awoke to find myself face-down in bed and fully dressed in yesterday's clothes. As I rolled over and sat up, taking the ceremonial first deep breath, I felt a sharp pain shoot down my side. A quick self-examination revealed bruises from my right shoulder to my right leg. At that point I thought: "Looks like something interesting happened last night."</p>

<p>Ah yes, then the blurry memory surfaced. Trekking through the Common on my way to catch a cab, I had made the auspicious decision to leap over a knee-high chain-metal rope. As luck would have it, my big feet caught the rope in mid-air and down I went, fast and hard. I apparently felt no pain because, as my father puts it, I had "Miller bones." </p>

<p>Friends, as wretched as my journey sounds, I am better for the experience. A Thursday night at the Red Hat is something of a course requirement. Thanks to years of "collaboration," the culture of our fair institution is inexorably intertwined with Old Scollay's finest watering hole. </p>

<p>History aside, where else near campus can you watch the Buchananites and the leftists scream at each other? </p>

<p>Where else can you toast to the secular Israeli Shinui party, or to liberalism, or Trotsky, and not feel, well, entirely solipsistic? </p>

<p>Where else can you trash country music, the president, and Jack Kerouac in the same conversation? All right. Anywhere. But where else am I going to go on a Thursday night? </p>

<p>Detractors of the Red Hat experience claim it's merely "Suffolk High" playing out over alcohol, which it can be, but the night is yours to do with as you please. On a good night there are certainly enough of us there that you can find the conversation or debate that suits you. Some of us enjoy working the crowd, shouting in German, passing out in the corner, or belittling others with fascist rhetoric. What's more, who doesn't enjoy waking up hoarse the next morning (usually accompanied by a stray buffalo wing)?</p>

<p>The true university experience is not solely resident in the classroom. It wholly encompasses all that a university is supposed to be: a place to develop as an individual, a place to learn who you are and where you stand. How are you going to find out who you are just by sitting in the back of a classroom?</p>

<p>While it has been decided that a night at the Hat doesn't quite reproduce "pub culture" as some of us fancy it, I think it's the closest we're going to get without transferring schools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only true negative is the morning after. A recent experience teaches a valuable lesson: think twice about going to the Shangri-La after you've had a few pitchers. I'm not going to say that there's anything wrong with their food, but if you're like me and you have some issues digesting Chinese food, make as conscious of an effort as you can to avoid the intestine-killer. </p>

<p>You're all adults, so I don't have to mention the part about responsible consumption. Perhaps I wouldn't even be qualified to: I had been asking myself lately which one of us is responsible for all the shots we end up taking - until I realized it was me. Well that's fine. But isn't this all an integral part of the college experience? </p>

<p>So friends, if you want to seize the present, pull up a chair and a pint of ale and we'll talk.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>I was going through my file cabinet the other day and I came across some old prints of the Suffolk Journal, and an article I wrote called "Bush's second tax cut is not the right move," regarding the then second installment of his administration's tax cut.</p>

<p>I believed that the rebate that was issued in July 2001 had failed by the fall to have any effect in revitalizing the economy. We are now a year and a quarter in the future and can plainly see that the second cut had no tangible effect except to eliminate any and all budgetary surpluses and to drive the federal government to a point where it must slash social spending to continue operating. Is this a joke? If so, I'm still waiting for the punch line.</p>

<p>The recently published 400-page "Economic Report of the President" (an economic Mein Kampf) details the administration's intended $700 billion tax cut package. </p>

<p>Is anybody else wincing at the size? Don't we already have a $300 billion deficit this year? Isn't there a projected $1 trillion shortfall for the next three years?<br />
This is entirely inappropriate. While it is understood that every presidential administration has its own fiscal goals, I'm not sure it could be any more obvious that Bush's cuts are reinforcing the pockets of his cronies.</p>

<p>With all the media attention on Iraq, there is little or no vocal opposition to this new tax reduction. Bush and his team merely say it will improve the economy and they ship it off to Congress. As I said last week, our current economic malaise is not the result of a drop in consumer demand, but of over-investment by businesses. This is all part of the business cycle; things will right themselves naturally. </p>

<p>Keep the $700 billion to insure the uninsured, fix social security, improve schools,and help states with budget shortfalls. We can do a lot of good with that money. But we're going to give the majority of it back to the wealthiest 5 percent, where it will sit in their bank accounts. </p>

<p>If we want to talk tax rebates, let's do the unthinkable: take $290 billion out of the $700 billion and set aside $1 million for every American. Allocate it to education, health care, and retirement. Instead of insignificant rebates that come at the cost of programs and services, let's make a difference and empower people. A meager $300 million could also be used for higher education credits to open minds and doors. At no point in our history have we been so wealthy yet as a people so disconnected from our own wealth. </p>

<p>Why doesn't the Bush administration set $1 billion aside for aid to those living below the poverty level? Take them off the streets, give them shelter, clothing, food and an education. There are people in America going hungry. </p>

<p>We're talking about removing $700 billion from the federal budget and there are children in our own cities without food. Don't we owe our own people the same humanitarian aid we intend for the citizens of Iraq? </p>

<p>We have been forced to live under these unspoken class rules but we don't have to continue this way. It is possible for us to redefine America. We just have to believe that we can change our environment. </p>

<p>Abandon the tax cuts. They don't work. They subsidize the wealthy at the expense of the average American.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Japan's economy has been mired in bouts of recession and deflation for the past 13 years. In its private sector we find a myriad of "zombie" companies that are being propped up with debt, because banks and politicians feel it would not be socially acceptable to let them collapse. These companies are now riddled with debt and for whatever revenues they do earn, a stifling percentage must be earmarked for debt repayment. The Bank of Japan has pursued a near zero interest rate policy for the past few years, but unfortunately it appears to have done little, if anything, to rejuvenate their ailing system. </p>

<p>The Japanese seem either paralyzed by pride or bereft of adequate solutions to take the necessary corrective steps. In December, Japan's unemployment rate reached its highest level in the post-war years. During a recent conference, Masajuro Shiokawa, the country's finance minister, proclaimed the figure to be "good news." After a member of his staff whispered something in his ear, Shiokawa retracted his declaration. It's these kinds of things that make you wonder how dedicated the Japanese government is to economic reform. Another huge problem facing Japan is the dearth of consumer spending. As people save their money due to uncertain job prospects, corporate revenues are hit, thereby placing a downward pressure on prices as firms compete for that scarcely spent yen. This h<br />
as caused moderate deflation to hit their economy. Now Japanese corporations are left with overwhelming debt and a currency in a tailspin, further reducing their ability to repay debt. </p>

<p>Sounds miserable, and what's worse, it can happen here. Just like Japan's recession in 1990, our malaise was predicted to subside in months. Both situations were stoked by fiscal and monetary medicine that was inappropriate for the illness. Like Japan's, our recession was not the result of a decrease in demand, it was the result of over-investment on the part of corporations. In this way, it is very similar to the crash of 1929, the recovery from which, as we are aware, took 12 years and a world war. Issuing tax rebates, as the Bush Administration has done, will not correct the problem when demand is not the cause. To skeptics like myself, it is fairly obvious what Bush's intention was, and it was not fiscal stimulus. </p>

<p>In Japan's case, the most obvious remedy would be to permit these somnambulist companies to declare bankruptcy, and ensure adequate unemployment protection for displaced workers. The net effect of this would be to dilute an over-saturated market, thus freeing capital for future expansion. Forest fires aren't always bad, they're necessary to attenuate density and fertilize soil for new growth. </p>

<p>We are witnessing the alternative playing out right now: stifling unemployment, a two-decade stock market low, and a nation's self-esteem in the dumps.<br />
Recent stock market declines and rising unemployment have caused the average savings rate in the U.S. to rise to 4.3 percent. While historically this is still a low rate, the preference for equity burned into our financial planning by the warp-speed 1990s left us with a dot-com sense of patience. At the height of the economic "bubble," in March 2000, there was $4.44 trillion in stock-centric mutual funds. As of last November, that same figure had declined to $2.82 trillion. Money market funds, however, which are asset-preserving, ultra-low risk and growth investment vehicles, saw their ranks swell by 36 percent to $2.3 trillion. If this net exodus from equity continues, we may witness a long-term erosion of returns, fundamentally altering the entire retirement services industry, especially if investors can get higher returns from bonds, CDs and savings accounts. </p>

<p>So what can we learn from the Japanese example? Tax rebates won't stimulate over-stimulated demand. The stimulus should consist of adequate unemployment protection and worker retraining to help those displaced. In our case, uncertainty over a possible war with Iraq has worked entirely against any and all "stimulus" packages deployed by the Bush administration. In order to right our economy, these fears need to be alleviated. Another lesson from the Japanese example is that interest rate cuts are not the deus ex machina to all economic troubles. Specific focus should be given to businesses so they may right their inventories and begin spending capital again.</p>

<p>It is relatively astonishing that thirteen years of statistics and policy shifts have not yet revealed the ultimate axiom: only when you correctly diagnose the ailment can you successfully apply the remedy.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>There is an apparent consensus in this nation of ours in which it is understood that a Democrat from our Commonwealth is "too liberal" to be elected to the presidency. I wonder whether this belief arises from a credible disagreement with Massachusetts' socioeconomic policy or whether it's unreasoned hearsay. For a select few it may be the former, but for the majority who hold this conviction, I assert it is the latter.</p>

<p>As we gear up for the Democratic civil war, everyone with a voice has now started to chime in with his or her opinions and analyses of the battlefield. </p>

<p>Time magazine recently ran a piece on the contenders, with Kerry's biggest potential liability being that "He's a Democrat from Massachusetts." We know the rest of the nation views us as "Taxachusetts," but are we just a state full of tax-and-spend liberals? Is this a place where businesses are chased away? Let's judge this on facts, rather than tired clichÈs. </p>

<p>It is true that our politicians, when compared to many nation-wide, are more apt to support social spending over tax cuts, so the cost of living in Massachusetts is somewhat higher than the nation's average. However, our jobs, on average, are higher paying. In addition, we boast a significantly lower unemployment rate than the national average. </p>

<p>In 2002 Massachusetts ranked number one overall in the State New Economy Index, an aggregate ranking of state job markets and economies with special focus on technical and knowledge jobs. We rank quite highly on several important sub-areas: third in the amount of "knowledge jobs", first in high tech jobs, first in broadband internet availability, first in venture capital expenditure, and second in the number of initial corporate stock listings as a percentage of gross state product. </p>

<p>This seems to contradict the not-so-spoken Republican belief that in order to have an economically vibrant state you have to eliminate social programs and services (and execute the occupationally inactive). </p>

<p>While Bush was governor of Texas, the state could claim the seventh highest poverty rate in the nation, there were 152 state-sponsored murders, and it was last place in social service programs. Indeed, he presided over the most active state execution program in the nation, while crime and poverty in Texas increased (obviously proving the deterrence factor). </p>

<p>Apparently almost half of Americans were eager to elect a man who worsened practically every quantifiable statistic while in office. Miraculously without the death penalty Massachusetts has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the nation. </p>

<p>Am I the only one that wonders why conservative men from statistically poor, uneducated, under-funded states (where social problems are ignored or exacerbated through poor policy) are running the country, while candidates from wealthier, more educated, more prosperous states are looked at as fringe? </p>

<p>I might be an apologist for Massachusetts' liberalism, but I'm proud of the fact that poverty has declined here by 1.4% from 1999 - 2001 (one of the only states in the nation to register a decline in poverty during the most "profitable" decade in American history). I think it might just be unpalatable for many conservatives to accept the fact that Massachusetts is working, and quite well.</p>

<p>I say that instead of Massachusetts being Kerry's biggest liability, it is his greatest asset.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>A specter is haunting American business, the specter of options expensing. Most of the vested speculators of capitalism have entered into a holy alliance to hunt down and exorcise this specter: Microsoft and President Bush, venture capitalists and CFOs, Wall Street and Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Just what are options, and why need they be expensed? Technically speaking, an option is a class of securities known as derivatives. Derivatives attain their value from an underlying security. An option, in this sense, gives a buyer the right to purchase a certain number of shares at a certain price, known as the strike price. These securities in recent years have been issued as a form of compensation by an employing company. It started as an auxiliary form of payment to the upper echelons of corporations, but soon became a staple of Silicon Valley. Simply put, they work like this: When one is hired, the company usually sets a strike price, say $5 per share, in an option to buy 500 shares. An employee can then exercise the option and purchase the 500 shares at $5 each. The logic is that one would only do this when the companyís stock is trading above $5.</p>

<p>This is quite the lucrative contract indeed. Many dot-com optionaires soon became millionaires when their companyís stock went public. Regardless of the monumental losses those same people may have experienced in the marketís decline, options have effectively elbowed their way into the mainstream. The current debate regarding options is how to properly account for them. Current GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) procedures currently demand a footnote regarding the amount of company stock given as compensation. The footnote states the amount of options issued in a diluted, per-share form, not as an expense on the income statement.</p>

<p>The income statement is traditionally the place where expenses are deducted from sales. Supporters of options expensing claim options are a form of compensation, and are thus required to be expensed. Is it a compensation expense? Undeniably, yes. Detractors say it will misrepresent earnings and distort company financials. What most options-crazed companies are afraid of is that when their options are expensed, their income statements are entirely flat. Yahoo!, for example would have realized minimal or no profits for the past five years if its options were expensed. Although this seems harsh, it would not be a misrepresentation. A corporationís value is a derivative, and the number of shares it issues has a bearing on that value. In the interests of transparency and fair accounting, these expenses should be noted in a format consistent with other compensation methods.</p>

<p>Over the past summer The Association for Investment Management and Research urged FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board), the board that sets accounting standards to require companies to expense options, and already some companies, like Coca-Cola, have voluntarily stepped forward and started expensing. That hasnít convinced everyone, however.</p>

<p>"Coca-Cola's decision doesn't change our view,'' said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman. "We just don't think there's a sound fundamental way that you can accurately expense stock options. We think it has a tremendous possibility of distorting earnings.''</p>

<p>I interpret that to mean ìWe think accurately reporting our income vis-?-vis our expenses has a tremendous possibility of causing our share price to plummet.î </p>

<p>One thing is certain, however. As both sides debate what is accurate and what a distortion is, the momentum for expensing is building. I say let the corporations tremble at the thought. They have quiet deception to lose, and we have a world of accurate accounting to gain.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>When Thomas Jefferson was elected president in 1801, he ushered in a new era in the nascent republicís stability. Jeffersonís election was the first successful internal party shift that the country had experienced; Jefferson and his Republicans (not todayís Republicans) defeated John Adams and the Federalists. Seldom in that era did pol<br />
itical power change hands without bloodshed or war. The dream of a stable Republic of the United States of America was then reality.</p>

<p>Jefferson was known for his staunch support for the democratic values of free speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. He was part socialist in his dedication to the common farm worker, part Libertarian in his belief in small government, and part Green in his reduction in the militaryís size and his support for environmental and agrarian legislation. Jefferson, notoriously, did not trust judges, bankers, merchants, as he was suspicious of their secretive, self-serving interests.</p>

<p>When his administration took office, Jefferson reduced the size of the military, as standing armies in those days were very unpopular. He viewed a large military as a threat and provocateur to peace. Jefferson also trimmed the budget of the government down to its functional minimum, which allowed the government to abolish most of the taxes it had imposed during the revolution, and the preceding two presidencies. He also established the state university system, with the creation of the University of Richmond. </p>

<p>How does this relate to capitalism? Well, the question should more accurately read: How can this relate to capitalism? We are, with little or no doubt, heading further and further away from the simple and pure republican ideals laid forth at the creation of the nation. Massive corporate interests lobby state and national legislatures successfully to further their interests. The average worker has seen his or her disposable income decrease over the past thirty years, while the wealth of the upper five percent has increased exponentially. As companies have grown larger and more influential, their profits and the salaries of their executives have soared similarly. While none of these actions are criminal, they are certainly harrowing and worthy of close scrutiny. </p>

<p>Americans need to take back their country through a peaceful awareness and a focused activism. We should not be afraid or intimidated by the business world; indeed, we should embrace it; as a keen business sense has given America its prosperity. What we must keep in mind is that it is entirely possible for a company to be profitable, its employees to be well and fairly compensated, its shareholders made contented, and it to be a good, positive member of the community. This was an early American virtue and now these virtues are endangered by a world-consuming style of greed.<br />
What can be done to correct this deviating course?</p>

<p>We can encourage support for small businesses, as entrepreneurship has provided America with over fifty-five million new jobs in the past century. While huge, hulking corporations are able to offer varied product lines at reasonable cost, we can all agree that massive, centrally planned organizations are never efficient. If we shift support and legislation to favor small, hands-on, decentralized, efficient organizations, we are, in effect promoting a more democratic capitalism. </p>

<p>We can also propagate Jeffersonian capitalism by authoring and supporting legislation that would put a public representative on all publicly-traded companyís board of directors. This would place a democratic voice inside a ìprivate tyranny.î</p>

<p>Yet another way would be to demand more transparency in trans-national organizations like the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization, that meet and deliberate in secret, yet have the legislative power to overrule democratically enacted tariffs and ordinances.</p>

<p>In brief, we now stand in the midst of an unprecedented era of economic prosperity and opportunity to work for positive change. We must use our business sense in conjunction with our moral and cultural sensibilities to work for a more democratic, American capitalism, to the benefit and prosperity of us all.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Two years ago this fall, Congress was in the midst of a debate regarding the number of skilled foreign professionals it granted work permits, or visas to. High-Tech lobbyists and certain members of congress argued that the country faced a disconcerting deficit of skilled technology professionals, and without the extra workers, American companies would have to delay or cancel new projects and products or scale back their current infrastructure. In October, 2000, a bill went before then President Clinton to move the cap to 195,000 from 65,000 for years 2001, 2002 and 2003, with the cap then returning to 65,000 in 2004. It was approved.</p>

<p>This ìwork permitî is known as the H1-B visa. It is under a category of permits known as ìnonimmigrant visasî because it is understood that applicants intend on coming to the U.S. merely to work, not to emigrate. In order to qualify, the applicant must have a U.S. Bachelorís degree or foreign equivalent, a professional job offer that closely parallels the education and training of a potential employee, and a host of immigration forms. On the surface it seems this program is a good way of getting foreign talent to the U.S. to fill an alleged knowledge gap among Americans.</p>

<p>Under closer examination, this program fits all of the patterns of a globalization of production maneuver, but it differs in that instead of a company relocating their production facilities to the third world (which they probably already are located), they are merely bringing the third worldís labor to America. Without much digging, it becomes evident that this program is a quaint kind of new economy sweatshop.</p>

<p>ìIncrease throughput while reducing costî ñ the mantra of a business education. It is that ìcostî factor that we are concerned with here. While the bill was before congress in 2000, something very unsurprising came to light: two separate Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiries revealed something that the H1-B lobbyists never mentioned publicly; that firms who employee H1-B employees are paying them on average $10,000 less per year than comparable native-born, similarly-qualified college graduates, and employers are under no obligation to provide them with benefits. Itís just old wine in new bottles.</p>

<p>While this program can represent an escape from third world countries in deplorable economic condition, it also places these workers in virtual part and parcel ownership of the sponsoring company. They cannot obtain another job while they are in the U.S. unless their new employer also sponsors them for the program, thus they are most often fearful of being released or laid off and thus deported. This pressure creates an unhealthy environment in which the visa holder can be held as a modern day skilled slave. If the threat of deportation loomed over your head, would you say ënoí to working late or working a Saturday if the boss asks?</p>

<p>The H1-B debate has recently gone quiet. Since the economy has dramatically cooled, and many workers (especially in IT) have been laid off, what should be done with the cap on the number of H1-B workers allowed into the country? Have employers started hiring the recently-laid off American IT workers now that theyíre available? In an April 2002 investigation by The Talent Economy, a high-tech magazine, the answer is a solid ìno.î ìThe government continues to receive, and process, applications from companies seeking H1-B IT professionals.î H1-B cost cutters have gone below radar, hoping nobody will notice.</p>

<p>There was also a clause added to the original H1-B visa bill that created a fee for each H1-B worker hired that the sponsoring company had to pay. It was first $500 per worker, now it is $1,000. ìA portionî of this money was to be used for domestic IT training. Several years have passed now. As to the effectiveness of this so-called training program? The U.S. Department of Labor recently listed it as ìineffective.î</p>

<p>Where does this leave American labor? During this economic squeeze, it will be the tendency of businesses to spend the least amount of money possible without a perceived reduction in quality. If a company has the option to hire a foreign worker for less money to do the same job, why wouldnít it? The government, conveniently for industry, makes no effort to promote education and training for Americans. This is strange, if both the government and industry have been crying for decades about a ìdrastic shortage of technology professionalsî. How curious.</p>

<p>While cost reduction is a must for competitive businesses, it must not be done in this way. It will be interesting to watch government activity regarding this issue given that the economy is experiencing an extended period of raised unemployment and little or no economic growth. Will the government roll back the cap and tighten the labor market to help American workers, or will it let them suffer so that the big high tech companies can save money, while denying the foreign H1-B workers basic benefits?</p>

<p>While it is easy to dismiss what the lobbyists and some senators say as being a mouthpiece for business, let us assume they are accurate in proclaiming a tech shortage. Logically then, the H1-B visa cap should be scaled back, since there are now thousands of unemployed and skilled American technology workers. This is the true test of whether the H1-B program is really just a cost cutting measure ñ and so far both government and industry have been suspiciously silent.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Radioheadís new release entitled ìI Might Be Wrong ñ Live Recordingsî leaves something to be desired. The band released this eight track compilation taken from dates in their European tour earlier this year in mid November amid unprecedented criticism that its contents somehow undercut their studio-recorded counterparts. While itís given that a bandís live set will never sound like the album ñ isnít it better that it doesnít? I was under the impression people went to concerts for the more personal sound a band delivers during live performances. Perhaps I was mistaken.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are some highlights to this disc. Radiohead is known for their enigmatic live performances, and while a CD hardly substitutes for a good show, it is certainly worth the money. ìThe National Anthemî, ìMorning Bellî, ìIdiotequeî, and ìEverything in its right placeî are from the bandís fourth release Kid A. ìI Might Be Wrongî, ìLike Spinning Platesî, and ìDollars and Centsî are from the bandís fifth release, Amnesiac.</p>

<p>ìThe National Anthemî, which contains layers of doodling vocals and guitars upon a parading bass riff, and ìIdiotequeî, which is laden with electronic beats and tones, sound thin and discordant. But others gems, like ìMorning Bellî, a keyboard-driven song that reaches a kind of spastic crescendo, do justice to their studio-recorded counterparts while keeping the emotion of the live set in place. Another such masterpiece is ìLike Spinning Platesî, one of the highlights from Amnesiac. The album version is considerably different, as it was made with various samples and keyboards whose ultimate product was engineered to play backwards, with vocals added to the reversed sound. Understandably, attempting to play your instruments backwards live is a daunting task, so presumably the band decided to alter the piece for their live set. The ultimate result is a delicate piano piece accompanied by nervy, seemingly hopeless vocals that give the song that kind of apocalyptic nihilism that Radiohead is known for. Thom Yorke drives that feeling into the listener with words like ìWhile you make pretty speeches / Iím being cut to shredsî and ìThis just feels like spinning plates / My body is floating down the muddy riverî.</p>

<p>The final track, ìTrue Love Waitsî is by far the highlight of the CD. The band never released this song, an asset previously findable only in bootlegged mp3 form. Previous to the bandís tour in support of Kid A, ìTrue Love Waitsî was only played once live, in 1995 in Brussels, Belgium. The version on this CD is just lead singer Thom Yorke playing acoustic guitar. The Brussels version features guitarist/keyboardist Johnny Greenwood on keyboards. Lyrics like ìTrue love waits / in haunted atticsî and ìIím not living, Iím just killing timeÖ donít leaveÖ donít leaveî end the CD with that typical Radiohead subtlety yet poignant significance theyíre branded for. The sense the listener is left with is that of a frantic, adoring person desperately trying to convince himself that the girl he loves will somehow respond and love him back. Itís a kind of fleeting despondency, but its something not so inconceivable that most people can relate to it.</p>

<p>That, in turn, is the archetypal Radiohead experience. A twisting, sort of bi-polar emotionalism that appeals to the downtrodden and ignored in all of us, only to rip it out and humiliate you in front of everyone with it. This live set is no exception. Itís a definite must-have. That is, of course, if youíre into that sort of thing.</p>
