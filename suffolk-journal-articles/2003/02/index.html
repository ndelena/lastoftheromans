        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Several Fridays ago, I awoke to find myself face-down in bed and fully dressed in yesterday's clothes. As I rolled over and sat up, taking the ceremonial first deep breath, I felt a sharp pain shoot down my side. A quick self-examination revealed bruises from my right shoulder to my right leg. At that point I thought: "Looks like something interesting happened last night."</p>

<p>Ah yes, then the blurry memory surfaced. Trekking through the Common on my way to catch a cab, I had made the auspicious decision to leap over a knee-high chain-metal rope. As luck would have it, my big feet caught the rope in mid-air and down I went, fast and hard. I apparently felt no pain because, as my father puts it, I had "Miller bones." </p>

<p>Friends, as wretched as my journey sounds, I am better for the experience. A Thursday night at the Red Hat is something of a course requirement. Thanks to years of "collaboration," the culture of our fair institution is inexorably intertwined with Old Scollay's finest watering hole. </p>

<p>History aside, where else near campus can you watch the Buchananites and the leftists scream at each other? </p>

<p>Where else can you toast to the secular Israeli Shinui party, or to liberalism, or Trotsky, and not feel, well, entirely solipsistic? </p>

<p>Where else can you trash country music, the president, and Jack Kerouac in the same conversation? All right. Anywhere. But where else am I going to go on a Thursday night? </p>

<p>Detractors of the Red Hat experience claim it's merely "Suffolk High" playing out over alcohol, which it can be, but the night is yours to do with as you please. On a good night there are certainly enough of us there that you can find the conversation or debate that suits you. Some of us enjoy working the crowd, shouting in German, passing out in the corner, or belittling others with fascist rhetoric. What's more, who doesn't enjoy waking up hoarse the next morning (usually accompanied by a stray buffalo wing)?</p>

<p>The true university experience is not solely resident in the classroom. It wholly encompasses all that a university is supposed to be: a place to develop as an individual, a place to learn who you are and where you stand. How are you going to find out who you are just by sitting in the back of a classroom?</p>

<p>While it has been decided that a night at the Hat doesn't quite reproduce "pub culture" as some of us fancy it, I think it's the closest we're going to get without transferring schools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only true negative is the morning after. A recent experience teaches a valuable lesson: think twice about going to the Shangri-La after you've had a few pitchers. I'm not going to say that there's anything wrong with their food, but if you're like me and you have some issues digesting Chinese food, make as conscious of an effort as you can to avoid the intestine-killer. </p>

<p>You're all adults, so I don't have to mention the part about responsible consumption. Perhaps I wouldn't even be qualified to: I had been asking myself lately which one of us is responsible for all the shots we end up taking - until I realized it was me. Well that's fine. But isn't this all an integral part of the college experience? </p>

<p>So friends, if you want to seize the present, pull up a chair and a pint of ale and we'll talk.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>I was going through my file cabinet the other day and I came across some old prints of the Suffolk Journal, and an article I wrote called "Bush's second tax cut is not the right move," regarding the then second installment of his administration's tax cut.</p>

<p>I believed that the rebate that was issued in July 2001 had failed by the fall to have any effect in revitalizing the economy. We are now a year and a quarter in the future and can plainly see that the second cut had no tangible effect except to eliminate any and all budgetary surpluses and to drive the federal government to a point where it must slash social spending to continue operating. Is this a joke? If so, I'm still waiting for the punch line.</p>

<p>The recently published 400-page "Economic Report of the President" (an economic Mein Kampf) details the administration's intended $700 billion tax cut package. </p>

<p>Is anybody else wincing at the size? Don't we already have a $300 billion deficit this year? Isn't there a projected $1 trillion shortfall for the next three years?<br />
This is entirely inappropriate. While it is understood that every presidential administration has its own fiscal goals, I'm not sure it could be any more obvious that Bush's cuts are reinforcing the pockets of his cronies.</p>

<p>With all the media attention on Iraq, there is little or no vocal opposition to this new tax reduction. Bush and his team merely say it will improve the economy and they ship it off to Congress. As I said last week, our current economic malaise is not the result of a drop in consumer demand, but of over-investment by businesses. This is all part of the business cycle; things will right themselves naturally. </p>

<p>Keep the $700 billion to insure the uninsured, fix social security, improve schools,and help states with budget shortfalls. We can do a lot of good with that money. But we're going to give the majority of it back to the wealthiest 5 percent, where it will sit in their bank accounts. </p>

<p>If we want to talk tax rebates, let's do the unthinkable: take $290 billion out of the $700 billion and set aside $1 million for every American. Allocate it to education, health care, and retirement. Instead of insignificant rebates that come at the cost of programs and services, let's make a difference and empower people. A meager $300 million could also be used for higher education credits to open minds and doors. At no point in our history have we been so wealthy yet as a people so disconnected from our own wealth. </p>

<p>Why doesn't the Bush administration set $1 billion aside for aid to those living below the poverty level? Take them off the streets, give them shelter, clothing, food and an education. There are people in America going hungry. </p>

<p>We're talking about removing $700 billion from the federal budget and there are children in our own cities without food. Don't we owe our own people the same humanitarian aid we intend for the citizens of Iraq? </p>

<p>We have been forced to live under these unspoken class rules but we don't have to continue this way. It is possible for us to redefine America. We just have to believe that we can change our environment. </p>

<p>Abandon the tax cuts. They don't work. They subsidize the wealthy at the expense of the average American.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Japan's economy has been mired in bouts of recession and deflation for the past 13 years. In its private sector we find a myriad of "zombie" companies that are being propped up with debt, because banks and politicians feel it would not be socially acceptable to let them collapse. These companies are now riddled with debt and for whatever revenues they do earn, a stifling percentage must be earmarked for debt repayment. The Bank of Japan has pursued a near zero interest rate policy for the past few years, but unfortunately it appears to have done little, if anything, to rejuvenate their ailing system. </p>

<p>The Japanese seem either paralyzed by pride or bereft of adequate solutions to take the necessary corrective steps. In December, Japan's unemployment rate reached its highest level in the post-war years. During a recent conference, Masajuro Shiokawa, the country's finance minister, proclaimed the figure to be "good news." After a member of his staff whispered something in his ear, Shiokawa retracted his declaration. It's these kinds of things that make you wonder how dedicated the Japanese government is to economic reform. Another huge problem facing Japan is the dearth of consumer spending. As people save their money due to uncertain job prospects, corporate revenues are hit, thereby placing a downward pressure on prices as firms compete for that scarcely spent yen. This h<br />
as caused moderate deflation to hit their economy. Now Japanese corporations are left with overwhelming debt and a currency in a tailspin, further reducing their ability to repay debt. </p>

<p>Sounds miserable, and what's worse, it can happen here. Just like Japan's recession in 1990, our malaise was predicted to subside in months. Both situations were stoked by fiscal and monetary medicine that was inappropriate for the illness. Like Japan's, our recession was not the result of a decrease in demand, it was the result of over-investment on the part of corporations. In this way, it is very similar to the crash of 1929, the recovery from which, as we are aware, took 12 years and a world war. Issuing tax rebates, as the Bush Administration has done, will not correct the problem when demand is not the cause. To skeptics like myself, it is fairly obvious what Bush's intention was, and it was not fiscal stimulus. </p>

<p>In Japan's case, the most obvious remedy would be to permit these somnambulist companies to declare bankruptcy, and ensure adequate unemployment protection for displaced workers. The net effect of this would be to dilute an over-saturated market, thus freeing capital for future expansion. Forest fires aren't always bad, they're necessary to attenuate density and fertilize soil for new growth. </p>

<p>We are witnessing the alternative playing out right now: stifling unemployment, a two-decade stock market low, and a nation's self-esteem in the dumps.<br />
Recent stock market declines and rising unemployment have caused the average savings rate in the U.S. to rise to 4.3 percent. While historically this is still a low rate, the preference for equity burned into our financial planning by the warp-speed 1990s left us with a dot-com sense of patience. At the height of the economic "bubble," in March 2000, there was $4.44 trillion in stock-centric mutual funds. As of last November, that same figure had declined to $2.82 trillion. Money market funds, however, which are asset-preserving, ultra-low risk and growth investment vehicles, saw their ranks swell by 36 percent to $2.3 trillion. If this net exodus from equity continues, we may witness a long-term erosion of returns, fundamentally altering the entire retirement services industry, especially if investors can get higher returns from bonds, CDs and savings accounts. </p>

<p>So what can we learn from the Japanese example? Tax rebates won't stimulate over-stimulated demand. The stimulus should consist of adequate unemployment protection and worker retraining to help those displaced. In our case, uncertainty over a possible war with Iraq has worked entirely against any and all "stimulus" packages deployed by the Bush administration. In order to right our economy, these fears need to be alleviated. Another lesson from the Japanese example is that interest rate cuts are not the deus ex machina to all economic troubles. Specific focus should be given to businesses so they may right their inventories and begin spending capital again.</p>

<p>It is relatively astonishing that thirteen years of statistics and policy shifts have not yet revealed the ultimate axiom: only when you correctly diagnose the ailment can you successfully apply the remedy.</p>
