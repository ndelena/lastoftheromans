            <p>In the wake of the dismal economic news before and after the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration courted the idea of increased government spending, but has made an apparent about-face and is now pushing further tax cuts.</p>

<p>Economist and economist ad nauseam has stated that the September 11th attacks have done little to effect the nationís economic integrity and that the rising jobless rate weíre seeing was imminent regardless of the attacks. Thi<br />
s may be so, and Americans may not have lost their confidence or their propensity to consume, but there most certainly will be lingering concerns in the hearts and wallets of Americans.</p>

<p>The last round of tax cuts, signed into law on June 7th, 2001 was of an estimated $1.35 trillion dollars. The government mailed out rebate checks, the values of which depended on oneís 2000 tax year filings. Bushís analysts predicted the ìstimulatingî effects of the rebates would hit in early autumn. It is now autumn and we see a consumer confidence rating at its lowest in three years, and an unemployment rate predicted to hit 6% by early 2002.</p>

<p>The tax cut did nothing.</p>

<p>Bush has denied Democratsí recommendation that $50 billion be added to the $60 billion in fiscal spending for 2002, by saying ìCongress doesnít need to spend any more money.î Democrats want to have this $110 billion set for increased unemployment and health benefits, as well as for infrastructure spending on bridges and roads.</p>

<p>Bushís newest plan is to accelerate the rate at which his June 7th tax cut law will decrease income taxes. According to his current legislation, each income tax bracket is scheduled to shed an additional 1% of owed income taxes for each year approaching 2010. He wishes to accelerate this by ìat least $60 billion.î If the previous round of tax cuts has shown us that this is imprudent fiscal policy, by this writerís logic repeating the same action will merely transfer funds from the government, where it is most needed, to the savings accounts of upper-class Americans. Where does the stimulus come into play? Economically speaking, those with the lowest rates of savings, typically those in the lower and lower-middle class, are more apt to spend and therefore would help the economy most by spending their rebate check. Ironically, it is their demographic that shall receive the smallest portion of a tax cut.</p>

<p>Bushís economic policies do not stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>In fact, under scrutiny, one can begin to see duplicitous motives of Republican fiscal theory. Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, the House Speaker, is seeking a cut in capital gains taxes as the centerpiece of a fiscal ìstimulusî package. His justification is that it will encourage Americans to spend more on ìriskier investments.î</p>

<p>Yes Mr. Hastert, I am certain that after John Doe gets laid off from his manufacturing job, he will consider purchasing a majority position in a small cap. Or, depending on his mood, he may instead decide to sell his 17th century Spanish villa in Boca Raton. Thanks to your capital gains cut, Mr. Hastert, he wonít have to pay as much after the sale!</p>

<p>Honestly.</p>

<p>Receiving an average annual income of $33,833 (Census Bureau year 2000 statistic), the average American does not have the liberty to buy and sell in equity or real estate markets as he or she pleases. While these may be Mr. Hastertís concerns, the majority of Americans certainly do not share them.</p>

<p>How then, would a cut in capital gains taxes stimulate the economy? A select few will incur less of an expense when they sell their assets. This paradigm of policy is self-serving and non sequitur.</p>

<p>Save the tax cuts, they donít work. They subsidize the wealthy at the expense of the average worker.</p>

<p>If economists predictions of economic recovery in the first half of next year are true and to be believed, the best policy option is to give temporary benefits to the temporarily unemployed and to create temporary jobs through infrastructure spending to keep those on the lower levels of the economic food chain active participants in the economy.</p>

<p>Tax cuts donít work.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Americans have not become wise to the appallingly obvious truth that interventionism is directly responsible for the attacks of September 11. The mujahadeen guerillas started as an Islamist rebel movement, operating against the socialist government that was in place at the time. This was before the Soviets even invaded. The United States armed and trained the rank and file of the mujahadeen guerillas. After twenty-two years of meddling in the Middle Eas<br />
t, the United States has earned the animosity of a great many peoples. We seem somehow surprised that the same people we worked with in the late 70s and 80s were affiliated with the radical Islamists who attacked us on September 11.</p>

<p>The United States may be the worldís only ìsuperpowerî, but surely that does not give it a mandate to ìpoliceî the globe in some kind of hunt for nobility or self-fulfillment. Violating the sovereignty of nations in acts of zealous altruistic military heroism is a farce; weíre assisting groups who dislike us against groups who dislike us even more. Intervening merely exacerbates anti-American sentiment.</p>

<p>In Chikeluba Kenechukwuís article in the November 14th print of the Suffolk Journal, entitled ìU.S. needs an interventionist foreign policyî, Kenechukwu states that the world benefits from American ìpolicingî. I feel this cannot be farther from the truth.</p>

<p>While I do not consider myself an isolationist, I do not support the type of unilateral military action Kenechukwu proposes America undertake. Kenechukwu states the world ìneeds a strong U.S.î What the world needs is a strong United Nations; a united front that achieves results through unanimity rather than unilateralism. While the United Nations is far from perfect, it is the only institution that derives its existence from the consensus of nations. The only consensus the President of the United States takes is that of his advisors (and not all of them at that). Should a group of ten or so people decide the fate of the world?</p>

<p>Kenechukwuís allusion that the United Statesí current anti-terror coalition-building efforts are part of some greater benevolence is naÔve. Do not for one instant believe anything the United States is doing right now is for the good of other nations. While removing al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan is a necessary response to September 11th, it is merely a knee-jerk, posthumous reaction that will primarily benefit America. Will we also remove the root causes of this radicalism? Are Americans even aware of why these attacks occurred? The ideological media has portrayed the radicals as anti-democratic, anti-Christian, and standing against the very principles that America was founded upon. While this may be true with the Taliban, it is not true with the majority of middle easterners, many of whom hold a closet-admiration of Osama Bin Laden and his cause. These ordinary people do not hate America because it is democratic, or secular, they hate it because the United States supports repressive regimes in their homeland. We rob them of democracy, when we pretend we are bent on propagating it. The Cold War brings countless examples. The Saudi regime is perhaps the most applicable. There is no such thing as a bill of rights in Saudi Arabia. There is no freedom at all. Dissent garners you an execution. The United States formed a partnership with the Saudi monarchy in the mid-50s to act as a counterbalance to increasing Soviet influence in the Arab world. The United States has a dubious track record of turning a blind eye to the basic rights of people so as to not upset their oppressors. It is not coincidental that the United States has a considerable interest in Saudi oil. Do you think we will fight for the rights of the Saudi populous, with the risk of losing oil? We have not yet, and I strongly doubt we will. In Saudi Arabia, American support for this regime is blatant and quite obvious to the local population. They know we back their oppression, and they resent us for it. Is it any wonder, then, that their destitute poverty, lack of freedom, and lack of opportunity breeds their radicalism? To them, it may be their only hope of breaking the oppression.</p>

<p>Examples of American inconsistencies in its conduct of ìselect interventionismî are innumerable. The situation in Kosovo before the NATO-led military campaign can be compared to the suppression of the Kurds in southeastern Turkey. While we quickly aided the ethnic Albanian Kosovars against their Serb oppressors, we looked the other way when Turkey, one of our closest allies, conducted the systematic abolition of certain nationalist elements of Kurdish society. This has been the case since 1925.</p>

<p>Doug Bandow, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, a national think-tank, testified before congress regarding NATOís intervention in Kosovo on March 10, 1999. Bandow asked ìWhat is the standard for making war?î He continued: ìYugoslavia has done nothing against America or any of its allies. Granted that Serbian treatment of Kosovars has been atrocious. So has the Turkish handling of Kurds. And the conduct of Indonesia in East Timor. As well as the behavior of two score other governments in a variety of conflicts around the globe. Is war the right remedy in these cases?î</p>

<p>Bandow also mentions Burundi, Cambodia, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Angola, Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, India, Pakistan, Mexico, Northern Ireland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Burma, Georgia, India, Indonesia, and Tajikistan as an extensive list of countries or regions of active or potential geopolitical instability. If America does what Kenechukwu proposes, we are certainly in for a third world war. And for what end? Why should America send its sons and daughters to die in these places? These are the worldís problems, not Americaís alone. Certainly comprehensive, diplomatic solutions can be reached in the halls of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Conveniently, another example of American neglect for human rights brought up by Kenechukwu, is that of Nigeria. For the past 41 years, Nigeria has largely been run by various military dictatorships. The various regimes that have ruled Nigeria were supported by the United States as bulwarks to Soviet influence in the region. They were, with little or no exception, brutal. Thousands were executed, including, in 1995, prominent ethnic Ogoni environmentalist, dissident, and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who fought against the environmental degradation of the Niger River Delta. The river is one of the most petroleum-rich regions in the world. Shell Oil operates a large facility in that area, and has been helping, with the blessings of the dictatorships, and indirectly the United States, to repress its workers, its neighbors, and pollute the Delta.</p>

<p>While it is true that Nigeria returned to a civilian-based government in 1999 (which it does every seven years or so), does that mean that offers of support and collusion from President Olusegun Obasanjo should be accepted with open arms? What has he done for the protection of the Ogoni workers or the Niger River Delta?</p>

<p>The answer is irrelevant. The United States turns a blind-eye to abuses in exchange for absolute support. What gives a nation that conducts this kind of activity a mandate to decide what nations violate its concepts of international law? The Soviets invaded Hungary in 1956 in what they considered a noble intervention; to stop the pro-democracy rebellion from seizing government. To the Soviets it was a just cause. To us it was oppression. An individual nation cannot objectively act in the best interests of others.</p>

<p>The only just intervention is humanitarian intervention, which must be carried out by a united world; with the consensus of the majority. The only vehicle in place to do that today is the United Nations.</p>

            <p>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereofî</p>

<p>Sound familiar? Itís the First Amendment to the United States constitution. It guarantees all Americans a secular society; the separation of church and state. Since September 11th, we seem to be witnessing an erosion of our secular guarantees and an emergence of religious overtones which can only alienate those not subscribing to a Christian viewpoint or a religious viewpoint altogether.</p>

<p>Paul Kurtz of the Council for Secular Humanism, a naturalist organization, wrote, in an open letter dated September 18th, 2001: ìWe wish to point out that the United States is a secular republic and that we do not have an established church or an official religion. Our population represents a wide spectrum of pluralistic cultures, ethnicities, and religious traditions, which include nonbelievers, atheists, and agnostics as well.î</p>

<p>With the recent, and seemingly instinctive reaction of the majority to revert to the archaic ìGod Bless Americaî tagline, and the dwindling opacity of the separation of church and state, Kurtz commented further: ìWe wish to dissent against the using of the Capitol rotunda and other governmental buildings for prayer meetings that focus on Christian or monotheistic ceremonies.î</p>

<p>It is certainly not that the Council for Secular Humanism is against organized religion. The Council would, in fact, defend the rights of those seeking to worship, however it also seeks to preserve our constitutional guarantees of secularism. Their beliefs hail from Stoics and Epicureans as well as Chinese Confucianism. Taken from their web site: ìThese philosophical views looked to human beings rather than gods to solve human problems.î</p>

<p>Isnít that what we all should be doing?</p>

<p>Pat Robertson, the notorious head of the Christian Coalition, in a polar-opposite letter dated September 20th and curiously headed ìDear Pastorsî writes: ìThroughout our history, our true protection has not come from our armed forces, our police, or our intelligence agencies. Our protection has been the covering hand of a gracious God, who centuries ago entered into a solemn covenant with our founding fathers who, in compact after compact and constitution after constitution, pledged their allegiance that America would be one nation under God.î</p>

<p>What perhaps Robertsonís aids forgot to tell him while he was pilfering out of his donation fund was that the phrase ìone nation under Godî was not added to the Pledge of Allegiance until the 1950s, the same time the phrase ìIn God We Trustî was added to the American dollar. Incidentally, this happens to be the same period of McCarthyism, which is no coincidence. What do these phrases mean to Atheists or members of the Buddhist, Hindu, Shinto, or even Muslim faiths? America is a pluralistic society and the government needs to respect this. Indeed, the government is bound by the constitution to respect this.</p>

<p>Some Americans feel that freedom of religion is not freedom from religion. In 1987, George H.W. Bush was quoted as saying ìNo, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered as patriots. This is one nation under God.î And this was our president? How would he feel about members of other religions? Were his comments just restricted to those who are unreligious? Let us not forget the long-standing (albeit fundamentalist) Christian belief that all religions except Christianity and Judaism are actually guised forms of Satanism.</p>

<p>This is certainly the viewpoint of the religious right and the viewpoint of those who misunderstand the Constitution of the United States. The founding fathers fled England because they were being persecuted for their minority beliefs. They came here not for the establishment of a religious nation, but for the establishment of a secular nation that guarantees (in the very first Amendment, notably) complete freedom of religion.</p>

<p>It appears our one-term ex-president failed to read the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli which stated ìThe government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.î</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson continued the secular stewardship: "Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, I contemplate with solemn reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" thus building a wall of separation between Church and State."   </p>

<p>If that is so, why does the current President Bush quote the bible in some of his speeches?</p>

<p>For many Americans, this is not a serious issue, or an issue at all, but to Americans who do not subscribe to the majorityís beliefs, this is a serious infringement upon our constitutional guarantees. I encourage all Americans of all beliefs to educate themselves on the laws of this country, and to encourage their fellow Americans to follow their own path, and worship or not worship who or whatever they choose. These are our rights and it is our duty to protect them.</p>
