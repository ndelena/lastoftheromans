        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>On October 18th, Noam Chomsky, a world-renown linguist, educator and political activist spoke regarding the ìNew War on Terrorî at MIT. Chomsky is the Institute Professor of Linguistics at MIT, a position he has held since 1976. His notoriety was developed through his founding of transformational-generative grammar, a conceptual system that revolutionized the study of linguistics, which was published in his book Syntactic Structures in 1957. Chomsky is also an avid political activist.</p>

<p>And thus he critiqued the U.S.ís new ìwarî on terrorism.</p>

<p>While he expressed his belief that the terrorist attacks on the United States were indeed a ìhorrendous atrocityî, he also noted its historical significance. ìItís a historic event because there was a change. The change was the direction in which the guns were pointed.î</p>

<p>Chomsky quickly got to his criticism of American aggression, stating ìSince the Second World War, [the U.S.] has extended its reach around the world in ways I donít have to describe. But it was always killing someone else, the fighting was somewhere else, it was others who were getting slaughtered. Not here. Not the national territory.î</p>

<p>He also criticizes the bombing of Afghanistan, quoting the New York Times as estimating the eminent starvation of 3-4 million Afghans. Chomsky did not appear willing to consider the logic of the current administration, instead suggesting that we have the power to alter our nationís course, ìWhatís happening now is very much under our control. We can do a lot to affect whatís happening.î</p>

<p>Chomsky portrays the United States as hypocritical in its new ìwarî by delineating past American military actions he deems as ìterrorist.î To Chomsky, such actions include the ìReagan-US War against Nicaraguaî, and our involvement in Haiti, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and our arms sales to Turkey and Columbia.</p>

<p>In speaking about Nicaragua, Chomsky paints it as a law-abiding state that responded to American ìinternational terrorismî by taking its cause to the World Court. ìThe World Court accepted their case, ruled in their favor, condemned what they called the ìunlawful use of force,î which is another word for international terrorism, by the United States, ordered the United States to terminate the crime and to pay massive reparations. The United States, of course, dismissed the court judgment with total contempt and announced that it would not accept the jurisdiction of the court henceforth. Then Nicaragua then went to the UN Security Council which considered a resolution calling on all states to observe international law. No one was mentioned but everyone understood. The United States vetoed the resolution. It now stands as the only state on record which has both been condemned by the World Court for international terrorism and has vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on states to observe international law. Nicaragua then went to the General Assembly where there is technically no veto but a negative US vote amounts to a veto. It passed a similar resolution with only the United States, Israel, and El Salvador opposed. The following year again, this time the United States could only rally Israel to the cause, so 2 votes opposed to observing international law. At that point, Nicaragua couldnít do anything lawful. It tried all the measures. They donít work in a world that is ruled by force.î</p>

<p>In comments shrouded in increased controversy, Chomsky stated the American strategy in its proxy military campaign in Nicaragua (through the US-backed guerillas) was changed to advise those guerillas to hit ìsoft targetsî ñ that is civilian institutions. Chomsky says this strategy change ìwas a bipartisan decision, incidentallyî and that ì[Americans] lauded the success of the methods adopted: ëto wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves,í with a cost to us that is ëminimal,í and leaving the victims ëwith wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations, and ruined farms,í and thus providing the US candidate with a ëwinning issueí: ëending the impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua.í The New York Times had a headline saying ëAmericans United in Joyí at this outcome.î</p>

<p>Chomsky, however, mentions nothing of the conditions leading up to the intervention.</p>

<p>In another interesting segment of his speech, Chomsky spoke about Turkeyís war against its Kurdish rebels in the southeast. One reason for Turkeyís eagerness to help the United States, he said, was because the Turks feel they owe the U.S. a debt of gratitude for helping them with their ìown massive ethnic cleansing and atrocities and terror.î He continues, ìThe United States,î he suggests, ìcontributed enthusiastically and decisively and was able to do so because of the silence, servility might be the right word, of the educated classes who could easily find out about it. Itís a free country after all. You can read human rights reports. You can read all sorts of stuff. But we chose to contribute to the atrocities and Turkey is very happy, they owe us a debt of gratitude for that and therefore will contribute troops just as during the war in Serbia.î</p>

<p>The primary motive behind the perpetrators of the September 11th acts is, as Chomsky states, ìThey are telling us just what they think.î He elaborated, ìThey are very angry at the United States because of its support of authoritarian and brutal regimes; its intervention to block any move towards democracy; its intervention to stop economic development; its policies of devastating the civilian societies of Iraq while strengthening Saddam Hussein; and they remember, even if we prefer not to, that the United States and Britain supported Saddam Hussein right through his worst atrocities, including the gassing of the Kurds, bin Laden brings that up constantly, and they know it even if we donít want to. And of course their support for the Israeli military occupation which is harsh and brutal. It is now in its 35th year. The US has been providing the overwhelming economic, military, and diplomatic support for it, and still does. And they know that and they donít like it.î</p>

<p>Chomskyís analysis of the situation is increasingly relevant in that he paints the picture of Americans being blissfully ignorant and idealistic. In a particularly poignant moment, Chomsky compares the comments of Ronald Steel, a left-liberal writer for the New York Times to a survey, done by the Wall Street Journal, whose participants were Middle Eastern businesspersons. Steelís comments were ìThey hate us because we champion a new world order of capitalism, individualism, secularism, and democracy that should be the norm everywhere.î Chomsky compared Steelís comments to the opinions printed in the Wall Street Journal, ìThe same day the Wall Street Journal is surveying the opinions of bankers, professionals, international lawyers and saying `look, we hate you because you are blocking democracy, you are preventing economic development, you are supporting brutal regimes, terrorist regimes and you are doing these horrible things in the region.î</p>

<p>Americaís history of acting unilaterally, Chomsky says, is about establishing ìcredibility.î He suggests that ìwhen you have an overwhelming predominance of violence and a culture of violence behind itÖit almost always works.î ìDo you want to know what credibility means? Ask your favorite Mafia Don. Heíll explain to you what credibility means. And itís the same in international affairs, except itís talked about in universities using big words, and that sort of thing. But itís basically the same principle. And it makes sense. And it usually works.î</p>

<p>As he concluded his speech, Chomsky spoke about solutions to the current crisis. He suggested a U.N.-sponsored initiative, with American and Russian backing, would be the most logical course of action, when the Taliban are removed from power. ìA sensible pro<br />
posal which is kind of on the verge of being consideredÖis for a UN initiative, which would keep the Russians and Americans out of it, totally. These are the two countries that have practically wiped the country out in the last twenty years. They should be out of it. They should provide massive reparations. But thatís their only role. A UN initiative to bring together elements within Afghanistan that would try to construct something from the wreckage. Itís conceivable that that could work, with plenty of support and no interference.î<br />
But in even more simplistic terms, Chomsky suggests the best way to secure the safety of Americans at home, is to abstain from violence abroad.<br />
 <br />
ìWe certainly want to reduce the level of terror, certainly not escalate it. There is one easy way to do that and therefore it is never discussed. Namely, stop participating in it. That would automatically reduce the level of terror enormously. But that you canít discuss. Well we ought to make it possible to discuss it. So thatís one easy way to reduce the level of terror.î</p>

<p>ìBeyond that, we should rethink the kinds of policies, and Afghanistan is not the only one, in which we organize and train terrorist armies. That has effects. Weíre seeing some of these effects now. September 11th is one. Rethink it.î</p>

<p>ìRethink the policies that are creating a reservoir of support - exactly what the bankers, lawyers and so on are saying in places like Saudi Arabia. On the streets itís much more bitter, as you can imagine. Thatís possible. You know, those policies arenít engraved in stone.î </p>

<p>Throughout most of his lectures and speeches, Noam Chomskyís oratory has always been edificatory ñ that is to induce free thought and to cultivate the conscience of the individual. And while a true Chomsky protÈgÈ would take everything with a grain of salt, his speeches do expose our oft-neglected responsibility to ourselves and the world.</p>
