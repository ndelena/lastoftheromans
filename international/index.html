Like the dinner guest you never invited, Silvio Berlusconi has returned to office in Italy, his party winning a majority in the Italian government. Italy, as I have stated ad nauseum, is in desperate need of reform. Berlusconi is not the man for the job. While a wildly successful billionaire businessman, Berlusconi is best known in the political arena for his cafone-like outbursts that place Italy in diplomatic gaffes. Here are some of his "best" quotes:<br /><ul><li>
<font size="2">
"I am the Jesus Christ of politics. I am a patient victim, I put up with everyone, I sacrifice myself for everyone."</font></li><li><font size="2">
"I will try to meet your expectations, and I promise from now on,
two-and-a-half months of absolute sexual abstinence, until [election
day on] 9 April."</font></li><li><font size="2">(To German MEP Martin Schulz, at start of Italy's EU presidency in July 2003)<b>:</b>
<p>
"I know that in Italy there is a man producing a film on Nazi
concentration camps - I shall put you forward for the role of Kapo
(guard chosen from among the prisoners) - you would be perfect."</p></font></li><li><font size="2">
"Let's talk about football and women." (Turning to four-times-married
German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.) "Gerhard, why don't you start?"</font></li><li><font size="2">
"Italy is now a great country to invest in... today we have fewer
communists and those who are still there deny having been one. Another
reason to invest in Italy is that we have beautiful secretaries...
superb girls."</font></li><li><font size="2">
"Mussolini never killed anyone. Mussolini used to send people on vacation in internal </font>
<font size="2">exile."</font></li><li><font size="2"><p>
"We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that
has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and - in contrast
with Islamic countries - respect for religious and political rights, a
system that has as its value understanding of diversity and
tolerance... </p><p>
"The West will continue to conquer peoples, even if it means a
confrontation with another civilisation, Islam, firmly entrenched where
it was 1,400 years ago." </p></font></li><li>
<font size="2">

"There is no-one on the world stage who can compete with me."</font></li><li><font size="2">(On a proposal to base an EU food standards agency in Finland, rather than the Italian city of Parma):
<p>

"Parma is synonymous with good cuisine. The Finns don't even know what prosciutto is. I cannot accept this."</p></font></li></ul>Some interesting press headlines from major news outlets show just how unenthusiastic 
Berlusconi's re-election was:<br /><br />International Herald Tribune: <br /><h1 class="headline">Economy ailing, frustrated Italy picks Berlusconi</h1><br />
CNN:<br /><h1 class="headline">Italian Billionaire Berlusconi 'wins' election</h1>
<br />The Independent:<br /><h1 class="headline">Disillusioned Italians head to polls again</h1><br />Reuters:<br />
<h1 class="headline">Giving it to Berlusconi</h1><br />and lastly Reuters columnist Robin Pomeroy:<br /><h1 class="headline">"Irreplaceable" Berlusconi set to "save" Italy</h1><br />
Since Berlusconi spent much of his last run at PM pushing laws to give himself immunity from prosecution, perhaps he will have enough free time now to actually push through some changes. But most likely it will be the same old <i>merda</i>.<br /><br />(The text on the picture above is Italian for "beware of dog.")<br />

Departing Prime Minister Romano Prodi (pictured above) was hailed as the right man for the job when he took office two years ago, however, his administration was plagued by in-fighting and fractures that ultimately unwound his governing coalition. Seats in Italy's Camera dei Deputati seem to award a disproportionate share to minority and fringe parties, forcing the larger ones to make "deals with the devil" in order to form a governing coalition.

(Today we'll unite Italy, or die trying). - Giuseppe Garibaldi, May 15, 1860<br /><br />Many people outside of Italy have never heard of Istria. To most it may sound like a fictional place. Istria is the Mediterranean's largest peninsula, located in the Adriatic sea, east of Venice, at the base of the Julian Alps. It first came under Italian domination after the area was Romanized in 177 BC. It remained either under Italian (via Venice) rule or Italian influence solidly through the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, in which Napoleon (occupier of Italy) ceded it to Austria in exchange for Mediterranean possessions. The period of&nbsp; Austrian rule, roughly from 1797 to  1918, correlated directly with the rise of the Italian unification movement (Italy since the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476 had been divided into various entities). The Austrians ruled over areas that were rightfully Italian and thus sought to complicate and block Italian efforts of reuniting the country. One of their most devious efforts was to dilute the Italian population by importing Slovenes and Croats from other parts of their empire.<br /><br />Charles Upton Clark, in the New York Times December 23, 1917 wrote, "<i>Austria then, has had just a century in which to win Istrian allegiance; and she has made use of every device known to the Teuton. By wholesale importation she has made the countryside Slav; but Italians still pay five-sixths of the rent tax, four-fifths of the income tax. She gives subventions to some fifty-five Croatian schools-those of Sts. Cyril and Methodius - but that it is purely missionary work is shown by the fact that Istrians contribute only about 10 percent of the receipts; the rest is supplied by the Government and private and clerical contributions from Croatia. Austria has filled Istria with German and Slav civil, military, and naval employees; in Pola, for instance, in the 1912 elections, only 1 per cent of the navy vote was for the Italian candidate. Italians, then, are as justified in feeling sympathy for their Istrian brethren as do the French for the Alsatians.</i>"<br /><br />Clark wrote further, "<i>Historically, then, Istria is a segment of unredeemed Italy. Geographically, she is as truly Italian. Italy is bounded by the Alps and the three seas; and the Julian Alps swing across the base of Istria, divide it off from the Slav hinterland, and give it, by their protection, a Mediterranean climate, with the olive groves and the vineyards so characteristic of Italy."</i><br /><br />Finally, at the conclusion of the First World War, Istria was given to Italy. However this would not last long, the short-sighted Italian governments of the postwar era became dominated by the fascists, who sought to undo the Austrian wrong by a forced Italianization of the recent Slav immigrants. It became forbidden to teach, worship, or conduct business in any other language than Italian. At the conclusion of the Second World War, with Italy surrendering to the allies, Istria was first occupied by the British, who handed control over to the Yugoslav Communist partisans. In the ensuing weeks, the partisans rounded up and executed Italians in what became known as the "foibe massacres."<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/assets/Istria_census_1910.html" onclick="window.open('http://lastoftheromans.org/assets/Istria_census_1910.html','popup','width=780,height=961,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/assets/Istria_census_1910-thumb-150x184.png" alt="Istria_census_1910.PNG" class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" height="184" width="150" /></a></span>Yugoslav troops remained in control of Istria until the territory was formally awarded to it piecemeal over several treaties. <br /><br />The population of Istria at the time, largely Italian, began a large-scale exodus to Italy proper, resulting of the peninsula losing approximately 80% of its inhabitants. The new&nbsp; Yugoslav Communist government quickly imported Slovenes, Croats, Bosnians, and Albanians to move into the houses and neighborhoods vacated by the native Italians. The situation was so desperate that the evacuating Italians took with them not only their belongings but also their dead. Some notable Istrians include race driver Mario Andretti, actress Alida Valli and Laura Antonelli, singer Sergio Endrigo, and boxer Nino Benvenuti.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/assets/Istria_ethnic2001.html" onclick="window.open('http://lastoftheromans.org/assets/Istria_ethnic2001.html','popup','width=410,height=288,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/assets/Istria_ethnic2001-thumb-150x105.png" alt="Istria_ethnic2001.png" class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" height="105" width="150" /></a></span>Some have said there was a tacit agreement by the postwar Italian government and the new Yugoslav government whereby Italy agreed not to pursue the foibe massacres of Yugoslavia ceased its demand for the extradition of Italian fascist accused of war crimes. <br /><br />Though ethically questionable, this sort of approach worked reasonably well in keeping Europe largely stable through the post-war era and through the demise of the Cold War. Europe as a whole appears to have deliberately left matters of the past unsettled, waiting for the period's contemporaries to pass, the issues to die, in the hope that a continent permanently (perhaps fatally) compromised and castrated will create itself a new identity.<br /><br />My question is, will old animosities be reignited when wealthy Italians start buying up inexpensive properties in Istria now that Slovenia is an EU member and Croatia is on the candidate list? Will the Istrian towns once again be called by their proper Italian names?<br />

            Anyone else notice how closely the national press follows polls? Not coincidentally, national coverage of the Iraq war has taken a back seat to the election and the economy, which seems to be a direct reflection of national polling[1]. <br /><br />It's commonly said that a good journalist constantly seeks to "afflict the comfortable" - that is to bring the most troubling issues of our time front and center to the least affected. While there are plenty of good journalists scouring the world reporting on some of the most horrid issues of our time, there is a terrible haze of disinterest amongst the American public for all things unpleasant. <br /><br />I don't propose this is anything new, but it seems to be more pronounced of late. <br /><br /><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/bush460.jpg" align="center"><br /><br />It all speaks to the cultural failure to assume personal responsibility. If you voted for Bush in 2000, or 2004, you are part responsible for this mess we're in in Iraq.<br /><br /><i>Dear American Public,<br /><br />Remember when you voted for Bush (at least once), and were cheerleading the Iraq invasion? What have you been up to lately? Ignoring casualty counts? Changing the channel when the coverage of Iraq starts? Yeah, look, you can't have it both ways. Sack up, admit you made a mistake, and learn your lesson to be skeptical of leadership like the founding fathers intended.<br /><br />Oh, and lose some weight you fat bastard.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Last of the Romans Management.<br /></i><br /><br />---<br />[1] http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm<br />

As much as we may gripe about the exclusion and single-mindedness of the American political parties, Italy is much the opposite. At current there are some 39 political parties holding seats in the Camera dei Deputati. They range from communists to xenophobes. Each government must set up delicate coalitions in order to create a governable majority. Prodi's was rooted in the center-left but involved communists. I believe his government was well intentioned but ultimately lacked the boldness needed to pass crucial reforms.<br><br>

Today Italy lags as the slowest growing member of the G8. According to some economists, Spain has now passed it in terms of GDP per capita. The south, not-so-affectionately referred to as the Mezzogiorno, is quite nearly another country; much poorer, much more rural, and with much more unemployment. Naples is awash in garbage; unions have refused to collect any additional trash because the Campanian dumps are overflowing. The EU is currently threatening Italy with penalties if it doesn't sort out the potential health disaster. Leadership is needed.<br><br>

What isn't needed, however, is a return of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. He's made remarks lately that indicate he wants to assume his old office a mere 20 months after being voted out. He spent the majority of his five year tenure making legal maneuvers to keep him from being prosecuted, neglecting the country's needed economic reforms. Italy today is one of the developed world's most heavily regulated economies.

Buona fortuna, Italia, you need it.

The election of Napolitano to the largely ceremonial post of Italian President was highly contested by outgoing former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's coalition of right wing parties, some of whom are former fascists. </p>

<p>It is a strange thing to watch by American standards.</p>

<p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/prodi_berlusconi.jpg" align="left" hspace="4">With the obnoxious side-show Berlusconi finally out of power, many expect Prodi's tenure to be a heads-down, dour term focused on rejuvinating the languishing Italian economy, which seemed not to be a priority for Berlusconi. Prodi will also seek to regain Italy's rightful role within the elite E.U. powers, now a triumvirate of the U.K., France, and Germany.</p>

<p>As Italy once again channels its foreign policy through the E.U. relations with the U.S. will grow slightly cooler. Expect now to see an Italian government that shares its people's distaste for the Iraq war and the Bush administration.</p>

The city's founding is shrouded in myth, but legend has it the city was founded by the orphaned brothers Romulus and Remus, after being nursed in infancy by a she-wolf. Eventually the two brothers fought over where the city should be founded, and Romulus slew Remus and founded Rome on the Palatine Hill. </p>

<p>Rome's contributions to European and ultimately human civilization are immeasurable. As Rome's influence spread, it found a sparsely populated, barbaric Europe and left it networked with roads, bridges, cities of brick and marble, endowed with language, arts, crafts and laws. </p>

<p>At its height the Roman Empire spanned an area greater than the United States and encompassed anywhere from 21% to 40% of the world's population. It's realm stretched from the cold and desolate Scottish border, through continental Europe, into the middle east as far as the Persian Gulf. It included all of present day England, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Armenia, Cyprus, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and included the majority of Austria, Morocco, Algeria, the Netherlands, Libya, Egypt, and the Czech Republic. One could not land on any shore of the Mediterranean and escape Roman arms. It's legacy can still be seen in the immensity of its architecture spanning then what was nearly the entirety of the known world. </p>

<p>Indeed the limits of Rome's power were seen as endless, as Josephus said as he pleaded with Judeans to end their rebellion against Rome's rule: "<i>That certainly they have seen their strongest walls demolished, and that the wall still remaining was weaker than those that were already taken. That they must know the Roman power was invincible, and that they had been used to serve them; for, that in case it be allowed a right thing to fight for liberty, that ought to have been done at first; but for them that have once fallen under the power of the Romans, and have now submitted to them for so many long years, to pretend to shake off that yoke afterward, was the work of such as had a mind to die miserably, not of such as were lovers of liberty. Besides, men may well enough grudge at the dishonor of owning ignoble masters over them, but ought not to do so to those who have all things under their command; for what part of the world is there that hath escaped the Romans, unless it be such as are of no use for violent heat, or for violent cold? And evident it is that fortune is on all hands gone over to them; and that God, when he had gone round the nations with this dominion, is now settled in Italy.</i>"</p>

<p>Rome's population reached its peak in the 2nd century AD at 2,000,000 persons. It did not reach this level again until the 20th century AD. It is no coincidence that the fall of the Roman Empire marked the start of the dark ages. </p>

<p>Happy 2,759th, Roma.</p>

<p>From Yahoo! News: </p>

<p>"<i>Final returns showed Prodi winning the lower Chamber of Deputies by one-tenth of a percentage point: 49.8 to 49.7 percent. Under Italian electoral law, 55 percent of seats are awarded to the overall winner regardless of the scale of victory, giving Prodi's forces at least 340 seats in the 630-member lower house.</p>

<p>According to official returns, Berlusconi's conservative allies held a one-seat advantage in the Senate, with 155 seats to Prodi's 154. But with some 852 overseas precincts out of 896 reporting, returns indicated Prodi's forces would capture another four seats, while one seat would go to Berlusconi's allies and one to an independent party, giving Prodi the majority.</i>"<br />
This is yet another country with pro-Bush leadership to flip sides as the fallout of Bush's foreign policy and the Iraq debackle spreads further and further. We saw elections in South America result in victories for the center-left for nearly all of the southern nations.</p>

<p>Berlusconi's coalition allies are the former neo-fascist National Alliance, pro-Vatican forces and the anti-immigrant Northern League. Prodi's are moderate Christian Democrats, Greens, liberals, Communists and former Communists.</p>

<p>You gotta love Italian politics. I'll be on top of this one.</p>

            <p>When I was in Rome in July, Kristen and I had noticed a phenomenon of sorts - masses of Europeans wearing shirts with English-language phrases. That in itself isn't remarkable, but what made it amusing to us was that the phrases made little or no sense and often were grammatically... creative. After the first day we started writing down ones we saw that we thought were most funny. I've sat on this list for quite a while and now that I have some free time I'm putting it up here for you all to read. Please note - that if you think you see a typo, chances are that is how it was spelled on the shirt.</p>

<p>With that, now, I give you Amusing English-language Phrases Found on European T-Shirts:</p>

<p>- "Why boys like me need boxe." <br />
- "Fucker boys"<br />
- "Back door boy"<br />
- "Canterbury 8th Man"<br />
- "Guess 8 Fabulous"<br />
