<i>Howard Dean's (L) beliefs for the Democratic party differ significantly with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's (at right).</i></p>

<p>As Condoleeza Rice's senate confirmation hearings got underway, the ideological divisions within the Democratic party shone through. During the first day, in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Barbara Boxer (D-California) was the most aggressive, saying Rice's loyalty to President Bush "overwhelmed [her] respect for the truth." Rice also declined to answer Democrats' questions as to if she believed extreme interrogation tactics amounted to torture. The only notable challenges to Rice came from Boxer and from Sen. John Kerry. I was particularly disappointed by Barak Obama (D-Illinois) and his failure to mount what could have been a very articulate criticism. </p>

<p>Eventually the committee voted 16-2 to approve her. The only Democrats who voted against her were Boxer and Kerry. It seems that the majority of Democrats on the committee, even with their questions, were resigned to a sense of self-fulfilling expectancy. </p>

<p>For years now there have been two schools of thought in the Democratic party, one believes that the only way to win elections is to soften core beliefs on abortion, gay marriage, taxes, social security, etc., etc., until the party becomes something like Diet Republican. The other school of thought - and the school of thought I subscribe to - holds that the Democrats' problem has not been it's core values, but rather the way it has marketed itself. Republicans have implemented a 30 year plan to take over talk radio, news shows, news columns, and to create a bond with the "common man" even though Republican policies generally benefit the uber-wealthy. My school of thought holds that the Democrats must stand their ground, reshape their image and fight harder for the values and ideas that have driven the better parts of the 20th century. Democrats must stand up and fight against the <a href="http://www.socsec.org/publications.asp?pubid=503">privatization of social security</a>, the increasing radicalization of America, and a disasterous foreign policy that has undermined us at every step. </p>

<p>The election of Howard Dean to the chair of the DNC would stand in stark contrast to the election of Harry Reid (D-Nevada) as Senate Minority Leader. Reid is somewhat of a Diet Republican and symbolic of the failure of Democrats to "firm up" their image and their beliefs. He has a very vague opposition to abortion and seems to meager to lead the party in the legislature. We know he opposes social security privatization. But do we know where he stands on other issues? (Not really.)</p>

<p>Dean on the other hand - like him or not - you know where he stands (much like George the W). During his campaign he vowed to win the support of the Southern working class (a 50 state campaign as opposed to the traditional 18 state campaign the Dems usually run). He would, if nothing else, cement the party to its base and hopefully give it a makeover the likes of which we have not seen since FDR's election in 1932 (and '36 and '40 and '44). <img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/ender.gif"></p>

            <p>Before you start the Obama-bashing...Remember, hes a first term Senator who has been dubbed the "future of our party"...He cannot, should not...and thankfully has not done any grandstanding...Obama needs to settle in, learn the tricks of the trade on the Hill and for the most part, keep quiet...There has been an awful lot of pressure on his shoulders since his coming out at the DNC...and he has a great position on the FRC (especially for a rookie)...I have faith he will be a huge asset to the Dems in the future...as for the rest...</p>

<p>Nick, the Kerry/Dean/Reid debacle has been well publicized in the MDF discussions...To take a line from one email...the Republians do a good job of lining up their opponents and shooting them, the Democrats on the other hand..do a good job of shooting each other....</p>

<p>I agree the marketing of our ideas has been horrible...but we also cannot shun any one Dem (Kerry/Reid) becuase of one or two of their beliefs...you don't Republicans publicly shunning the likes of Mr. Spector (instead you see the Republicans handle their shit quietly and internally)...My biggest fear is the 30 year plan you mention...Although it may seem some are becoming Diet Boehms...the fact is we need to learn from their strategies...and their strategy has been to make every issue black and white, and make people see and believe their side is right, no questions asked....our problem, and it was apparent in the kerry candidacy, is that we think too much...we need a clear, concise message and we just arent getting it...although I think Dean might be a step in the right direction in that sense....</p>

            <p>One other note on Condi's confirmation....</p>

<p>This is yet another classic example of us being kept quiet because of political reasons...the problem with making a big fuss about the confirmation is that the Republicans will paint a very believable picture (to the average American) that Democrats are being unpatriotic, especially in a time of war...</p>

<p>I know, I know..complete BS....</p>

<p>but you have to take that into consideration politically...I think if Democrats (especially Obama) were to speak out (vote against Rice), they would be tar and feathered by the cabal of conservative spinsters...so what it comes down to (becasue of the effectiveness of the Republicans) is would you rather have Democrats who speaks out and gets crushed in their next election by a Republican opponent or would you rather have a Democrat who maybe has to play by Republican rules for awhile until we get our shit together...and this is the truth we have to face because right now we have to rebuild... </p>

<p>and the fact is..Kerrys vote makes him seem bitter..and once again feeds into his flip-flopping...but maybe this time he actually grew a set and will be willing to take a stronger stand on a lot of issues...although i doubt it</p>

            <p>You and your moderate acquiescences can lick my crotch, Arrigo.  The last thing Obama should do is moderate himself to comply with Republican standards, a concept which is itself ridiculous: you know damn right the neo-cons would be frothing at the mouth if a Democratic president tried to appoint someone like Ted Kennedy, for instance.</p>

<p>I think the message we should take from the Republicans' success is that liber<br />
als should feel free to go ahead and be hypocritical -- to espouse one thing as a figurehead, as a moral compass (e.g., democratization, Christian values) and to act completely independently of those distractions.  </p>

<p>The Republicans are masters of misdirection, which is why they win.  Bush could send 100,000 more troops into Iraq tomorrow, and he'd get away with it because he would get behind a podium and purport to be furthering American, Christian, and democratic values -- waving his right hand around for the benefit of his audience while with his left he flagrantly pursues his own interests.</p>

            <p>The majority of Americans can't even read above what the National Center for Education Statistics terms a Level 2 reading ability (out of 5).  Why should I care what the opinion of the uneducated is?</p>

<p>Interestingly, the same studies identify a strong correlation between low reading ability and the tendency to vote in state and national elections.  In other words, one of the reasons that we have such a low voter turnout in this country is because half the country is so poorly educated that they are either too intimidated by the political system to vote, are simply unaware of the importance of every vote, or are so burdened by the other consequences of being poorly educated that they simply don't care.</p>

<p>So when the "majority of Americans" are educated enough to adequately discern one political "view" from another, then maybe I'll give a shit about whether they find those views "palatable".</p>

<p>You say two different things here, unless I am reading this wrong. First part says that the uneducated are more likely to vote. Second part interprets that as people are too stupid to vote so why should you care about what the people think. </p>

<p>You guys refuse to see the difference between disagreeing with democrats and being stupid. Yet you listen to the so called republican talking heads and see consistent disagreement with the president on matters of the boarder policy, immigration, out of control spending, and even certain aspects of the war. Personally I add to the list his energy policy and the death penalty. I go to church regularly and even I think he over plays his faith in God, though I do believe his faith is genuine. And for Congress, how the republican leadership could allow the democrats to filibuster any judicial nominee is ridiculous. All business should have been halted and the senate kept in session until a vote was held on all nominees. Republicans are getting weaker as they get more of a majority in government, and it is disappointing.</p>

            <p>What I intended to convey was that those studies show that the under-educated are <i>less</i> likely to vote.  Sorry if my wording was unclear.  </p>

<p>That said, my ultimate point was that I given that so much of the U.S. population doesn't vote due to this factor, those that DO vote are rather misrepresentative of the people at large.  So why should I care whether they find my ideas palatable?  Moreover, why should I care what someone who doesn't vote due to partial illiteracy and under-education, thinks about what I have to say?</p>

<p>Despite the fact that as Americans we're all entitled to our opinions, one really should not opine on a subject about which one has little to no real knowledge.</p>

            <p>The palatability of liberal or leftist ideas is not the question. It is not what caused Bush to be reelected. Democrats have consistently failed (1994 on) to deliver a concise, succinct platform that panders to the five second rule of the American attention span. The Democrats have just failed at marketing themselves. You can say some Democrat values are out of step with Americans - like secularism (unfortunately) perhaps, but I could just as easily say that Republican plans for widespread privatization are out of step as well. </p>

<p>And lastly, there is no difference between disagreeing with Democrats and being stupid. (ha ha).</p>

            <p>No, that really wasn't what I was getting at. Perhaps at the complete mediocrity of the Democratic Party's ability to sell themselves. Jim, I'm sorry you find everything non-fiction to be mediocre. Maybe you can start a political party of cyberpunk mercenaries. You can even stitch little calculators and casio organizers into your tattered suits and fingerless-gloves. Orrrrrrrrrr you can join us in the real world.</p>

            <p>"That said, my ultimate point was that I given that so much of the U.S. population doesn't vote due to this factor, those that DO vote are rather misrepresentative of the people at large. So why should I care whether they find my ideas palatable?"</p>

<p>You should care because our Democratic-Republic is based on the opinion of the majority of voters (uneducated or not, small turn out or not)  to determine who they would prefer to see lead the country. If all of the people that don't vote cared enough they would, but it is not my job to vote the opinion of people that don't care to vote on their own. The fact that they are unwilling to take an hour or two out of their day once a year tells me I don't want their opinion to count anyway. If you want a voice, vote, if you don't vote, don't expect others to consider your opinions when casting their vote. </p>

<p>If you keep assuming it is the marketing of your ideas vs the ideas, you will continue to lose elections. I don't know why you assume people want the government to 'hold' their Social Security account for them, and continue to use it in the general fund. Funny how you all bash this idea when it was the dems that initially proposed it.</p>

            <p>You're missing the point: I'm not saying these people don't vote because they don't care, I'm saying they don't vote because they haven't been educated to understand its importance, which translates to not caring.  It translates to not caring because when you are uneducated, you are far t<br />
oo concerned with putting food on the table and keeping your children safe in fourth-world ghettos (urban squalor has been referred to as the "fourth world") where violence and crime are everyday things.  Or, you're a Southern Christian of one of the more ridiculous sects who is equally uneducated and equally unaware of how badly you're being fucked over.  </p>

<p>And Nick, if I thought that everything non-fiction was mediocre, I certainly wouldn't be reading this site.  CNN is not the be-all-and-end-all of political involvement, and nobody really cares what the capitol of Oman is.  I remember a time when you actually liked talking about fiction, by the way.</p>

            <p>First it is not only the super poor in the inner cities that don't vote. And it is not strictly because they want to keep their kids safe. They are worried about keeping their children safe from others in their own communities not rich guys that believe in God and low taxes. </p>

<p>Secondly, your assumption that the only other groups that don't vote are Southern Christian groups returns you to making the 'if you don't agree with me you're a moron' argument, which has done wonders for democrat candidates in the past few years. Do me a favor, keep going that route.</p>

            <p>Correction on that second point: You say that southern Christians don't vote because they are too stupid to know they are getting fucked over. I wanted to make the point that they do vote, and your opinion on the reason for their stupidity is what is making the demorats lose elections.</p>
