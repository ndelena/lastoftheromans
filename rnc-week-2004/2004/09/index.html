            <p>True to form, another example of the continued Republican blurring of truth has emerged after the convention. This time it's not about George Bush!</p>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, everybody's favorite Austrian immigrant governor, lied in his convention speech about having witnessed communism firsthand under Soviet occupation, and having left Austria in the 60s as a "Socialist" government.</p>

<blockquote><i>"It's a fact Ã± as a child he could not have seen a Soviet tank in Styria," the southeastern province where Schwarzenegger was born and raised, historian Stefan Karner told the Vienna newspaper Kurier.</i>

<p><i>Schwarzenegger, now a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born on July 30, 1947, when Styria and the neighboring province of Carinthia belonged to the British zone. At the time, postwar Austria was occupied by the four wartime allies, which also included the United States, the Soviet Union and France.</i></p>

<p><i>The Soviets already had left Styria in July 1945, less than three months after the end of the war, Karner noted.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>Regarding the Austrian government in power in 1968 (the year Schwarzenegger left):</p>

<blockquote><i>What's more, when Schwarzenegger left in 1968, Austria was run by a conservative government headed by People's Party Chancellor Josef Klaus, a staunch Roman Catholic and a sharp critic of both the Socialists as well as the Communists ruling in countries across the Iron Curtain.</i>

<p><i>Schwarzenegger "confuses a free country with a Socialist one," said Polaschek, referring to East European Communist officials' routine descriptions of their countries as Socialist.</i></blockquote></p>

            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/bush-hands.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="4" alt="George bush describes the Federal budget deficit.">With the end of the week comes the end of the Republican National Convention's "All 9/11, all the time" God-festival at Madison Square Garden. Between bouts of Elizabeth Dole saying "Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion" (how can freedom be conditional?) and Schwarzenegger's "If you have a pulse, you're a Republican" diatribe, we have George duh-byah's convention closer, a perfectly crafted Sept. 11th PR device designed to simultaneously play to the fears of Southern dolts and enrage tri-staters (and New Englanders) who were personally affected by the attacks. </p>

<p>Having watched the speech with a native New Yorker provided a line by line validation of my belief that Bush's continued milking of the 9/11 tragedy is nothing more than a disgraceful election tactic to rouse the NASCAR, 9/11 souveneir buying crowd. In Boston I think we are close enough to the tragedy to see when ethical lines are clearly crossed; when the issue has moved from healing wounds of a national tragedy to garnering single point percentage gains in key battleground states. But in having the convention in Manhattan, the Republicans have shown machiavellian acuity at the cost of sincerity. And it is sickening.  </p>

<p>Bush's speech was merely a collection of reactionary rallying cries crafted to appeal to the inherent desire of all Americans to see their country safe and happy. The true Orwellian genius here is how Bush insists the natural human desire for safety is inexorably linked to the Republican sociopolitical platform. It is further designed to blur the line between the Iraq war and the war on terrorism, to blur the justification of that war from weapons of mass destruction to removing a despot: "Do I forget the lessons of September 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time." Repeated statements by the 9/11 Comission that Iraq and al-Qaida were not cooperating in any way are brushed to the side.</p>

<p>The Kerry campaign needs to point these things out and furthermore it needs to express to the American people that the world is not black and white, right and wrong, good and evil. It is a complicated, highly nuanced world, and we need an intelligent, dare I say brilliant leader who can understand details and intricacies and generate sincere, well thought out strategies based on the aggregation and extrapolation of these data. Anyone with a brain and a computer can easily learn the basic governing philosophies of Hussein's Ba'athist movement and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida. </p>

<p>The Ba'athist party emerged in the 1960s as (ironically) a pan-Arab socialist alternative to despotic right-wing monarchies. It was wholly secular (sometimes Atheist) and followed for some time the principles of Socialism. al-Qaida is rooted in the ultra-orthodox religious backlash to the Arab socialist movement. It seeks full integration of mosque and state and full implementation of Islamic Sharia law. It effectively advocates a return to the style of life of the 7th century A.D. Now bear in mind, Hussein's government hardly represented Socialism as it was intended, but it is clear to see that the two philosophies are squarely incompatible.</p>

<p>Bush's speech was light on the economy and bin Laden, light on future plans other than to say he wishes to see the power of corporations and HMOs protected, and the power of the people to seek a redress of grievances eliminated or suppressed. He made Afghanistan and Iraq seem like the Cirque de Soleil, having failed to mention that kidnapping and murder are rife in Baghdad and the Hamid Karzai government of Afghanistan only controls the capital of Kabul, the remainder of the country is in the hands of warlords, much as it was for the past twenty years.</p>

<p>My prediction of a second Bush term: increasing interest rates, lagging job growth, tax reform to favor multinational conglomorates, tort reform to favor corporations, a further blurring of the separation of church and state, and, dreadfully, perhaps Supreme Court appointments of right-wing reactionaries. A thought that should rightly shake anyone of reason to the bone.</p>

<p>From the Daily Show: "For four years George W. Bush has used the power of words to overcome insurmountable facts."</p>

<p>Admittedly, I was concerned when I heard about Zell Miller speaking at the Republican National Convention. It's always damaging when one of your own (debatable) breaks ranks and goes on national television to tell America why your party doesn't deserve the vote. I was concerned. But after I saw his speech, reminiscent of George Wallace and the hate-filled segregationists of the 1960s, I realized that it would probably do more damage to George Bush's reelection than to Kerry's campaign. Granted, Miller's style is inflamatory and sensationalistic, but this time his age shown and his speechwriter's lack of preparedness also shown; the main themes of his Diatribe Against Democrats (DAD) are wholly without substance. </p>

<p>His main points were: 1) Democrats view American troops as "occupiers" and therefore are treasonous, 2) Kerry does not support the U.S. military as demonstrated by his votes against certain military budgets that would have expanded production orders for the B-1, B-2, F-14, F-15, F-16, M-1 and Apache fighting vehicles, 3) something about nobody being like Wendell Wilkie anymore.</p>

<p>1) Interestingly, it was George Bush who first referred to American troops as occupiers.<br />
<b>April 13, 2004 8pm prime time press conference.</b><br />
"As a proud and independent people, Iraqis do not support an indefinite occupation - and neither does America."<br />
"They're not happy they're occupied. I wouldn't be happy if I were occupied either."</p>

<p><b>May 24, 2004, 8pm, press conference from the US Army War College, Carlisle, PA.</b><br />
"The occupation will end, and Iraqis will govern their own affairs."</p>

<p><b>May 25, 2004, interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation's John Shovelan.</b><br />
"On June 30th, the Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist and will not be replaced. The occupation will end, and Iraqis will govern their own affairs."</p>

<p>I would be willing to bet that Bush has referred to our troops more as occupiers than Democrats have.</p>

<p>2) Kerry in his tenure in the Senate had approved 16 of 19 budgets. The ones he didn't approve, interestingly, Dick Cheney, as Secretary of Defense under George H. W. Bush also did not approve of. He was famous for imposing strict spending controls. Cheney at the time said: "You've squabbled and sometimes bickered and horse-traded and ended up forcing me to spend money on weapons that don't fill a vital need in these times of tight budgets and new requirements." Referring to the M-1, F-14 and F-16 as "great weapons" that we "have enough of."</p>

<p>3) Of Wendell Wilkie, Miller says: "In 1940, Wendell Wilkie was the Republican nominee. And there's no better example of someone repealing their 'private plans' than this good man. He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time. And he made it clear that he would rather lose the election than make national security a partisan campaign issue."</p>

<p>Actually, that's not quite accurate. Wilkie campaigned against Roosevelt's New Deal and advocated increased military spending. Roosevelt preempted that by expanding military contracts during the campaign - so Wilkie switched directions and accused the president of "warmongering." The election was held (Miller makes it sound like Wilkie withdrew) with Roosevelt garnering 449 electoral votes to Wilkie's 42. It was only after this election that Wilkie decided to support Roosevelt, eventually becoming his personal representative to Britain.</p>

<p>Zell Miller's style is light on facts and heavy on fiery southern-fried rhetoric. </p>

<p>I did some additional investigating into Miller's past and found something that sheds some light on his oratorical style (and perhaps his nascent party-shift). In the 1960s, Miller was the Chief of Staff for Lester Maddox, Georgia governor and segregationist. Maddox was so virulently racist that he distributed axe handles to patrons of his family-owned restaurant the night the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed, to keep African Americans from entering his restaurant. That same night he chased protesters away with a pistol. As Governor he openly advocated defiance of the act. And now we're supposed to find Miller a credible critic of the Democratic party. Well frankly, our party is much better without him and his new allegiance to the GOP is just as fitting.</p>

<p>"If you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government... then you are a Republican! If you believe a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group... then you are a Republican! If you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does... then you are a Republican! If you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children... then you are a Republican! If you believe this country, not the United Nations, is the best hope of democracy in the world... then you are a Republican! And, ladies and gentlemen... if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism... then you are a Republican!"</p>

<p>Please allow me to dissect this line by line.</p>

<p>1. If you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>I think the passage of the USA Patriot Act rather disproves this, in addition to rather disproving any pretensions the Republicans might have of being the party of non-intrusive government.</i></p>

<p>2. If you believe a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>This is easy: Cheney's Haliburton did $73 million in business with Saddam Hussein during the 1990s, had Arthur Anderson as Haliburton's accounting firm (same on as Enron). Additionally, through the use of subsidiaries and 44 "tax friendly" shelters, Haliburton became a subsidized company, rather than one that had to pay taxes. Interestingly, when Cheney left to become the vice presidential candidate, Haliburton gave him a $34 million retirement package. Now, of course a campaign contribution of that size would surely have been illegal... so it was just a retirement package. Of course. Condoleeza Rice had a goddamn Chevron oil tanker named after her. Andrew Card lobbied on behalf of GM against stricter emissions standards. Spencer Abraham, Secretary of Energy, proposed to get rid of the Energy Department thre times in his stint as a Michigan Representative. He also received donations from Enron. U.S. Trade Rep Robert Zoelick was a paid consultant for Enron. Michael Powell, Chairman of the FCC is Colin Powell's son.  Bush named Michael Powell head of the FCC.  The FCC presided over a case involving AOL.  Colin Powell served on the board of AOL and is a significant holder of AOL stock.  Michael Powell was the only member of the FCC to advocate that the AOL-Time Warner merger go through without investigation. You want to tell me this administration is free of special interest?</i></p>

<p>3. If you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>The most successful attack strategies the Republicans have launched against Democrats have been on taxes. They've painted the specter of Democrats as waiting in the hollows for their moment to strike, raising taxes to 95%, picking pockets of old women and stealing piggie banks. Yet let's think back, was the tax rate of the Clinton administration oppressive? I remember doing quite well back then. In fact, I earned more in 2000 then I did this year, since I got laid off by the Bush economy. Regardless, Arnold's statement isn't entirely false: Your family probably does know how to spend its money better than the Bush government. We have a record budget deficit of $400 billion a year, projected to be closer to $500 billion with the immense and growing cost of supporting the Iraq occupation. Our outstanding total debt grows at $1.72 billion dollars a day, swelling to $7.36 trillion dollars (or $25,000 per capita).</i></p>

<p><i><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/us-debt.gif" alt="1999 chart detailing 10 years of projected budget surpluses" hspace="2" align="left">I know the public memory is short, but lets think back to the end of the Clinton administration. Back to 1999. I quote a BBC article: "Last year, the government had a surplus of $69.2 billion, a total which is likely to be exceeded this year. It is the first time since 1957 that the US has had two consecutive years of budget surplus. Official projections suggest trillions of dollars in budget surpluses over the next 15 years, boosted by a strong economy and strict controls on spending." This was an administration of Democrats. Let's not forget that. And if you also remember the Republicans in power at the time demanded that all budget surpluses be given back as tax cuts, instead of paying down the debt so that our nation isn't foreclosed by the foreign debtors we owe. The graph above shows a "what if" scenario - what if Clinton's economic policy of debt repayment had continued. Well, this year, instead of having $7.36 trillion in debt we'd have $2.8 trillion and shrinking. Do we think these debts can continue to amass?</i></p>

<p>4. If you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>If you believe we should trick Democrats into voting for an educational reform package, then not fund the program, you're a Republican!</i></p>

<p>5. If you believe this country, not the United Nations, is the best hope of democracy in the world... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>Just take a look at our involvement in the following countries: Philippines, 1945-53 (fighting letist Huks even as Huks fought off Japanese); South Korea, 1945-53 (establishment of right-wing dictatorship, not democratic until 1983); Italy, 1947-48 (prevented democratically elected Communists from taking power); Greece, 1947-49 (supported former fascists in civil war); Albania, 1949-53 (failed coup attempt); Iran, 1953 (ousted democratically elected Mossadegh); Guatemala, 1953-1990s; Indonesia, 1957-58; British Guiana/Guyana, 1953-64 (ousted democratically elected Socialist); Vietnam, 1950-73; Brazil, 1961-64 (ousted democratically elected socialist); Dominican Republic, 1963-66 (ousted demo<br />
cratically elected socialist); Indonesia, 1965 (liberal Sukarno ousted, fascist Gen. Suharto put in power); Chile, 1964-73 (assasination of PM-elect Salvador Allende); Greece, 1964-74 (supported monarchists/fmr. facists in civil war); Nicaragua, 1978-89 (funded right-wing paramilitaries against democratically elected sandinistas); Grenada, 1979-84 (ousted socailist government, installed brutal fascist dictatorship); Afghanistan, 1979-92 (Zbignew Brezinski wanted to "give Soviets their own Vietnam" and drew Soviets in, funding mujahadeen forces. After Soviets withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, leaving the country devastated and in the hands of power-hungry warlords) ; El Salvador, 1980-92 (supported an insurgency of right-wing paramilitaries); Haiti, 1987-94; Iraq, 2003-? (tricked congress into giving executive branch imperial-style powers by providing false intelligence, disposed former ally Hussein, installed Iyad Allawi, former Ba'athist into power. Allawi personally shot six Iraqi prisoners in order to "send a clear message to the police on how to deal with insurgents.").</i></p>

<p>6. And, ladies and gentlemen... if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>There's definitely no evidence to say that Democrats don't want to defeat terrorism. In fact, we would probably have a much more level headed approach than the prevailing neo-con "pave the world" policy. A concerted effort to root out poverty and political and economic injustice in the middle east might be a good start.</i></p>
