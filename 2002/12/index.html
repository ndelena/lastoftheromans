            <p>i hate mondays.</p>

<p>once again i could be found among the corporate trappings of fidelitor investmonger. i worked about nine hours today, then headed back to <b><i>1625!</i></b> before going to the gym in copley. i rocked about 530 calories off. i'm not even tired now. i <i>almost</i> just broke out the espresso cooker and made my trademark, servicemark, copyrighted espresso & french vanilla cream but i decided against it, as tomorrow, i once again must raise myself before the cold-fearing sun peaks its head above the dirty, snowy streets of this fair city. </p>

<p>"You're working on new year's eve?" </p>

<p>Hey, if the stock market is open, I'm open baby. </p>

<p><img src="http://www.infinitelimitation.org/misc/2002-12-30-pager.jpg" align="left" hspace="4">i have officially been indoctrinated into the corporate/IT realm with the arrival of my two-way skytel pager. if you've ever walked down the financial district, it seems like at least a quarter of the peole walking around have these things clipped to their sides. anyway this thing is pretty cool. it is its own e-mail box- you can dial a 1-800 number and enter my PIN and have a message sent, you can send an e-mail directly to it, or you can send a message through the skytel website. and it has a little keyboard on it so i can write back. </p>

<p>but the best part: i can get an unlimited amount of news, weather, market updates. right now i have market updates at 9, 1, and 4:30pm. so i get market predictions at 9, a mid-day update at 1 and a closing analysis at 4:30. that and weather and us/world news updates throughout the day. how do they expect me to get <i>more</i> work done now? ha ha.</p>

<p>then i had to drop the car off in severe.</p>

<p>i again came across the infamous spring '99 business law notebook.</p>

<p>the last page reads:</p>

<p><i>'12:37 am. blue line. between aquarium and maverick.<br />
i see two girls out of the corner of my eye<br />
upon turning my head<br />
i notice their faces are bloodied<br />
the girls exit the train at maverick.<br />
and immediately collapse.<br />
i continue reading.'</i></p>

<p>and written on the back cover, in all caps is:</p>

<p><i>'PROFESSOR IN FETAL POSITION, SUCKING THUMB UNDER DESK.'</i></p>

<p>and lastly i'd like to show off my 'kazak' steppe militia hat, which i found when i went home today.</p>

<p>nite nite.</p>

            <p>wow.</p>

<p>apparently i have the ambition to make a little entry at this time. </p>

<p>erg. l<br />
et's see. it's almost three in the morning. tom and i went out earlier to the rack in faneuil hall because one of the girls he knows from nscc was turning twenty-x   (twenty three?) tonight and since i don't live that far away we figured we'd drop by and have a few. i was completely thrown off by the rack. not what i expected at all. i felt like i had to compete with every male in there. it is such a bridge and tunnel crowd. it's like saugus and revere got together and decided to invade a boston establishment. yech. so we ended up leaving and coming back to my hood in an attempt to hit flann's up... but unfortunately flann's had already announced last call, so they weren't letting anyone in. our only hope was the chopping block (ick.). so we went there. tom had substantial success with the ladies. he managed to meet a girl (who attempted to take his barstool) that goes to his school, then some girl with dyed pink hair (who reminded me of james's mother...) was making eyes with him and as he moved in for the kill, she head-butted him, b/c she got knocked over). it was a messy situation. but i felt like i didn't fit in in either place. i was dressed for the rack, but i felt like i wasn't 'flashy' enough for a place like that. when we got to the chopping block (which i can see from my living room) i felt like i was overdressed. yech. i need to find a place that is my vibe. </p>

<p>yech. yech. drink drink drink.<br />
feel woooozy.</p>

<p>sleeeep.</p>

<p>i feel great today.</p>

<p>1625 update: the heating situation here has always been erratic. right now we have the thermostat set to about 69 degrees. yet the temperature in the hallway is 51. daaa. i have to keep my door closed to my bedroom because the heat generated by my electric space heater will dissipate instantly with that gateway to the arctic open. it seems as though the heat only comes on at night. <i>you know what that means, shiiiieeeet</i></p>

<p>i may go to AC Hardware and get some window insulators. the kitchen and bathroom are unfathomably frigid. </p>

<p>i stayed home from work today. i decided that it would be smarter to say home rather than risk getting sicker. plus i can work from home, so there is a negligible opportunity cost. *bonus*</p>

<p>what else? i won $50 on a scratch ticket that my mother's boyfriend got me. w00t.</p>

<p>and i don't feel like i'm going to vomit! i must be on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>i rented minority report from my brookline blockbuster today. i had meant to see it at the theatre, but i was probably working... or... not... oh those macrosoft days. those fucks.</p>

<p>i was supposed to work from home today, because of all this snow, but i couldn't even sit at my desk without getting queasy. so i basically spent my entire morning & afternoon in my bed. i think i'll be well enough to work in some capacity tomorrow. i could work from home. i might. we'll see how i feel when the ol' alarm goes off at 7.</p>

            <p>i bought lottery tickets tonight for the first time since 1998. </p>

<p><i>'I had the shot, so I took it.'</p>

<p>'You took it- and broke a major rule of engagement.'</i></p>

<p>I don't particularly endorse the lottery as a surefire method of financial growth, but the prospect of a $280 million jackpot made my dissuasion a bit difficult.</p>

<p>earlier, at work, i was discussing with james what i would do with such immense wealth. my first step would be to secure and insure the money, then to buy my mother and father houses, wherever they wanted. i would then begin looking for a multi-level loft apartment. i think i would pick the corner of arlington & newbury as an ideal (and ultra swank) location. skylights are a must, and fireplaces in every room. on the first night in the apartment, i would owe it to myself to throw a massive, raging party. my twelve month goal would be to start a venture capital firm. and i would finish my degree, as scheduled, in may. but enough of that pipe dream.</p>

<p>tonight as i drove back from revere, i noticed that the roads were fairly congested. at first it shocked me, it was after midnight on christmas eve - shocked almost as if driving at this hour was illegal - and that we were all in quiet collusion - a rolling rebellion of solidarity to all the evils of christmas.</p>

<p><i>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.<br />
Et lux perpetua luceat eis.<br />
Te decet hymnus, Deus, in Sion,<br />
Et tibi reddetur votum in Jerusalem.<br />
Exaudi orationem meam<br />
Ad te omnis caro veniet.</i></p>

<p>there is a belief among christian fundamentalists that christ will return only when the jewish people have wholly reoccupied jerusalem. christ will return, and offer the jews a chance to convert to christianity. if they refuse, he will damn them to hell.</p>

<p><i>ad te omnis caro veniet indeed Domine. </i></p>

<p>while i am opposed to most theist machinations, i will offer a heartfelt wish for all:</p>

<p><b>Et lux perpetua luceat nos</b> may perpetual light shine on us...</p>

<p></p>

<p><i>And when you've taken down your guard <br />
If I could change your mind... <br />
I'd really love to break your heart <br />
</i></p>

            <p>Looks like my web server disappeared. The IP address probably changed again. I think I'm going to install cygwin on there again and get that IP check program up and running, probably with James's help. Since Fidelity is getting me a Motorola T900 two-way pager, I can have the server page me when the address changes. That would be insane. I'm really at the point now where I might just go and get a speakeasy sdsl or adsl connection (with two static IPs) at the apartment. I could run the server there and never have to worry about IP address changes. The only problem is that the service is something on the order of $89/mo. Yikes. There is, perhaps, revenue potential there... </p>

<p>Anyway. It's about 10am, christmas eve. I drove to work today. It was a fairly astonishing process. I had resigned myself to a belief that Huntington Ave would be congested, and Stuart street a nightmare. I think I got here in 15 minutes. It was pretty amazing. The only negative: I'll probably pay about $15 in parking. Assholes.</p>

<p>This whole holiday season is bogus. It really is less about giving and caring than it is about revenue forecasts, eps goals, and quarterly reports. Don't tell me that earnings are flat - did you see the mall yesterday? Christ. These retail chains have to streamline if they can't make enough money from thirty days of mad, frantic shoppers filling the aisles of their stores.</p>

<p>Rock.</p>

<p><br />
I'm leaving work at 1 today. I'm going to head to Revere and fix the stupid server. Then maybe go back to the apartment for a while and finally update my website (picture galleries, suffolk journal articles). I'm looking for ways to integrate or streamline some processes on there through ColdFusion, but I can't think of any cases where the functionality achieved would truly outweigh the amount of work done. </p>

            <p>Zaterdag [dutch: Saturday] was a blur... 14, 15 beers? awake until 7am on the worn down wood of the living room floor playing 'drunk driver'. tom passed out. casey dropped out hours earlier. </p>

<p>i felt like mild death when i awoke five hours later. like the beer was seeping out my pores.</p>

<p>melissa told me of a flattering, if entirely ludicrous theory developed by the girls at 140 prince last weekend: that every girl i know is 'secretly in love' with me because i'm 'everything a girl wants'. </p>

<p>that's news to me.</p>

<p>this apparently followed a discussion on how talking to me is 'intimidating' to some people. [i think the example was a game of asshole we were playing where i asked a trivia question to give away a clear card and nobody could answer my questions. it wasn't like i was talking about quantum mechanics... i think i asked who was president before kennedy... daaaaaaaaaa. um, people, this is <i><b>YOUR</b></i> life.]</p>

<p>my goal is not to be intimidating, but to act as a catalyst for some kind of intellection. i realize that can be a lofty goal sometimes. but i will still cling to my romantic ideal of fraternization: sitting around a dimly lit table (preferably in europe) with a few friends, a few drinks, some cards, talking about politics, or literature, or film... but <i>really</i> talking about it, not just paying it lip service.</p>

<p>that's the stuff that gets me going.</p>

            <p>There's a group here at Fidelity that developed a huge database for us, with a front-end interface that allows us to maintain a knowledgebase for this initiative we're working on. Even though it's the same company, they still bill us for the project. It seems stupid, I know. But what <b><i>is</i></b> stupid is that they bill us for the time it takes them to fix the bugs they created.</p>

<p>Maybe that can fly when it's an internal thing, but imagine if companies operated like this to each other. Imagine selling a product to someone broken and saying "wait, wait, if you want it to actually work, well then, that's another $200."</p>

            <p>most exciting part of the day: my mp3 collection has swelled to 3,635.</p>

<p>today was one of those days where i wanted to destroy everything. i get that way sometimes.</p>

<p>on my way back from the gym in copley, on the 39, what appeared to be an unstable man started yelling at a man who was standing in his way saying "would you please move so i can get by?" and when it became apparent that the man had headphones on and didn't hear him, the guy says "oh, you didn't hear me because you have headphones on, you're one of those dumb fucks, you motherfucker, you motherfucker!" </p>

<p>as he was saying this, a woman who was sitting said "that's not polite language".</p>

<p>he instantly replied "shutup bitch, nobody told you to speak up."</p>

<p>unfortunately for me, my stop was next, and he also got off. and started talking to me.</p>

<p>"those people. those people on that bus. they are strange. they're so strange. those people from jamaica plain. they are so strange. i'm glad i don't live in jamaica plain. it's filled with lesbians, and... and feeeggeets and and and even hispanics!" </p>

<p>um, pal, you live on mission hill.</p>

<p>maybe the slaughter of the unstable isn't such a bad idea after all. imagine if this guy has kids.</p>

<p>i hosted the n'th annual suffolk journal christmas party at my apartment. big flop. there was, perhaps, at the most seven of us. it was still diesel though, eight hours of drinking. </p>

<p>my apartment is particularly cozy today. maybe it's the rain effect, but it's welcoming and warm. slowly the living room is getting more like a living space and less like a mausoleum of collegiate life.</p>

<p>the submission deadline for <i>venture</i>, suffolk's annual literary magazine has just passed. i missed it. but the english department is going to accept my late submissions. every year i've been at suffolk it's gotten worse (with the notable exception of the pages i adorn).  </p>

<p>and now, for e-dracula:  { :-C</p>

            <p>i make the best coffee.</p>

<p>i was talking to my father recently regarding my uncle. he's a fireman in revere, and has been awaiting promotion for ten years. fireman are required by massachusetts law to take what is called the "captain's test" to qualify to be promoted to captain. my uncle has passed, in first place, every t<br />
wo or three years (whatever the law states) when the tests are mandated, yet he has not been promoted.</p>

<p>about ten years ago, then mayor haas refused to promote my uncle because he didn't support him in his election campaign. my uncle sued, and won, three times, costing the city something like $60,000 in legal fees, and still the mayor did not promote him. in 1999, a new mayor was elected, and with him the promise that the promotions would be granted based on achievement. my family rallied behind this mayor, in the hope that my uncle would finally get promoted. the mayor (harvard educated in fact, i think that's a first for revere... the educated part, i mean) decided to promote one of his friends <i>over</i> my uncle. not only that, he's decided now to form a committee whose whole purpose is to recommend who to promote. don't be fooled- this isn't democracy at work, this committee is merely a justification and projection of his will... they vote as he wishes.</p>

<p>i am reminded of the roman emperor tiberius, who, if you will recall, was the second emperor of rome. in his time, when they empire was still new and the notion of the republic was still engraved in men's minds, emperors were careful not to openly admit and exercise their true power, for fear of a republican revolution. tiberius would preside over the senate and by his commentary the senate would know how to vote. to give the illusion of a free and independent senate, when tiberius spoke against a measure, the senate knew to vote for it, and when he spoke in favor of it, the senate knew to defeat it. </p>

<p>not much has changed for democracy over 1,960 years.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>A specter is haunting American business, the specter of options expensing. Most of the vested speculators of capitalism have entered into a holy alliance to hunt down and exorcise this specter: Microsoft and President Bush, venture capitalists and CFOs, Wall Street and Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Just what are options, and why need they be expensed? Technically speaking, an option is a class of securities known as derivatives. Derivatives attain their value from an underlying security. An option, in this sense, gives a buyer the right to purchase a certain number of shares at a certain price, known as the strike price. These securities in recent years have been issued as a form of compensation by an employing company. It started as an auxiliary form of payment to the upper echelons of corporations, but soon became a staple of Silicon Valley. Simply put, they work like this: When one is hired, the company usually sets a strike price, say $5 per share, in an option to buy 500 shares. An employee can then exercise the option and purchase the 500 shares at $5 each. The logic is that one would only do this when the companyís stock is trading above $5.</p>

<p>This is quite the lucrative contract indeed. Many dot-com optionaires soon became millionaires when their companyís stock went public. Regardless of the monumental losses those same people may have experienced in the marketís decline, options have effectively elbowed their way into the mainstream. The current debate regarding options is how to properly account for them. Current GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) procedures currently demand a footnote regarding the amount of company stock given as compensation. The footnote states the amount of options issued in a diluted, per-share form, not as an expense on the income statement.</p>

<p>The income statement is traditionally the place where expenses are deducted from sales. Supporters of options expensing claim options are a form of compensation, and are thus required to be expensed. Is it a compensation expense? Undeniably, yes. Detractors say it will misrepresent earnings and distort company financials. What most options-crazed companies are afraid of is that when their options are expensed, their income statements are entirely flat. Yahoo!, for example would have realized minimal or no profits for the past five years if its options were expensed. Although this seems harsh, it would not be a misrepresentation. A corporationís value is a derivative, and the number of shares it issues has a bearing on that value. In the interests of transparency and fair accounting, these expenses should be noted in a format consistent with other compensation methods.</p>

<p>Over the past summer The Association for Investment Management and Research urged FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board), the board that sets accounting standards to require companies to expense options, and already some companies, like Coca-Cola, have voluntarily stepped forward and started expensing. That hasnít convinced everyone, however.</p>

<p>"Coca-Cola's decision doesn't change our view,'' said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman. "We just don't think there's a sound fundamental way that you can accurately expense stock options. We think it has a tremendous possibility of distorting earnings.''</p>

<p>I interpret that to mean ìWe think accurately reporting our income vis-?-vis our expenses has a tremendous possibility of causing our share price to plummet.î </p>

<p>One thing is certain, however. As both sides debate what is accurate and what a distortion is, the momentum for expensing is building. I say let the corporations tremble at the thought. They have quiet deception to lose, and we have a world of accurate accounting to gain.</p>

            <p>a most strange and brilliant thing occured today.</p>

<p>as i was assembling my new <a href="http://www.infinitelimitation.org/misc/new_desk.jpg" target="_new">desk [click for a picture of the handsome bastard]...</a></p>

<p><br />
i happened to look out my corner window and notice a girl with a bollieflex camera attached to a tripod walking in the alleyway behind my apartment. this girl at first resembled someone that i knew quite well, but would now prefer not to see... so i was quite taken aback. but the bollieflex was a shocker... i actually inherited one when my grandfather passed away. he had been high up in the audio/visual department of raytheon and was a surveillance photographer during the korean war- hanging out of helicopters by a belt, with a huge, lumbering metal camera mounted to his chest... anyway, these cameras are box shaped, with two lenses on the front, and a hatch that opens on top, so you actually look down to see your camera's view. well this girl proceeded to walk directly across the alley from my window, and set her tripod up, with her camera pointed at my window. i didn't know quite what to make of it, but i stayed in the window, drinking my coffee and watching. she must have taken a picture or two then moved to a different position, to take more, still aimed at my window. she did this several times.</p>

<p>at this point i realized that if i didn't grab my digital camera and take a picture (of her taking a picture of me), not a soul would believe this.</p>

<p>the picture is <a href="http://www.infinitelimitation.org/misc/photo_girl.jpg" target="_new">here</a>.</p>

<p>after i took this picture she left, heading back down the alley way, which leads to wigglesworth st, then she turned toward tremont st. </p>

<p>i dismissed the incident, thinking it was the photographic pining of some mass art girl, but curiousity got to me and i decided to take a walk to my car, which was parked about a block down tremont, in front of subway. as i got within sight of my car, the girl was there, tripod extended, taking a picture of my car! i walked in a hurried pace, but she turned a corner and disappeared.</p>

<p>i can offer no logical explanation of these events.</p>

<p>stephen crane. thanks steve. </p>

<p>how true is that?</p>

<p>i'm writing a paper on fiscal & monetary policy, in my room, with candles burning.<br />
sometimes when i look around the room i think i see a thin pale smoke... like the candles are slowly replacing oxygen with charcoal and carbon dioxide. well, they are, i suppose...</p>

<p>i think brookline is a place i would like to live. somewhere near coolidge co<br />
rner. there was an ad in the fidelity exchange for a one bedroom apartment for $900 in that neighborhood. maybe i'll end up there in september. </p>

<p>there or manhattan. in my suit and bmw. and sunglasses. soulless. </p>

<p>someday i'll make a significant contribution to Real GDP.</p>
