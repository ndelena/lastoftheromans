            <p>I had dinner tonight with the matriarch. We got into a lengthy discussion about names. My mother had apparently wanted to name me Justin. I would have killed her. Nothing against the Justins of the world, but I'd gladly take my Nicholas over Justin. Cheers to the patriarch for the 'Nicholas James' combo. </p>

<p>My mother has quite a nasty smoking habit. And her boyfriend as well. I've always hated cigarette smoke, but being in bars made me somewhat immune to it. However, since Boston went smoke free I've also become largely exposure-free and I was especially sensitive to it tonight. They don't smoke near me, as they know I don't like it. But just having it around me made my eyes dry and my throat burn.</p>

        <div id="more" class="asset-more">
            <p>Another interesting topic was my great grandmother. She's still alive, at the age of 89. She was born in 1914. First generation Polish-American (her maiden name was Biczkoska). Sometimes I forget that people are living history. It is amazing to think of what she has witnessed. </p>

<p>This brings me to another topic. Largely, my family has been gifted with longevity. The DeLenas in particular are long-lived, stoic chaps. We've a good relationship with blood pressure and cholesterol and don't typically gray until our sixties. My grandfather, the magnapatriarch of the DeLena family recently turned eighty-one. Here is a man who survived the great depression, a german artillery attack that blew off part of his foot near milan, and having to put up with my father for forty-six years and at eighty-one he still shovels the snow from his driveway (much against our wishes). "I need the exercise" he says.</p>

<p>For the past year now I've become somewhat preoccupied with Roman history. I've always been a history nut, with a specific interest in Rome, but lately I'm concerned more with the similarities between modern America and the Roman Empire (or late republic). Particularly how Rome declined and ultimately collapsed and how (if at all) that can be applied to the United States. Most of the connections I've managed to make are less than encouraging. Decline</p>

<p>Speaking of artillery...</p>

<p>Can we talk about the situation in Iraq? Oops, sorry we have a guerilla war on our hands now. But don't worry Johnny American, we have the good ole U.S. Army, this won't be another Iran, 1953 / Guatemala 1953 / Indonesia 1957 / British Guiana 1960 / Vietnam, 1950-73 / Congo 1960 / Dominican Republic 1963 / Chile 1973 / Nicaragua / Grenada / El Salvador / Honduras / Haiti / Somalia... or any of the other conflicts we (or our proxy forces) have been embroiled in. Nooooo of course not.</p>

<p>It is particularly painful to see one's predictions slowly coming true. We protested at length here in Boston when this started. The night the attack commenced we walked in the pouring rain for five hours, over ten miles with police around is in every direction. Why? Because we knew something like this would happen. Because it wasn't right. Thousands of Iraqis, most largely innocent and hundred and fifty young and naive American soldiers are dead. On average, fifty Americans are dying in Iraq a month. But the figure has been increasing each month we are there. At this rate, if we are there five years, which has been discussed as a possibility by the Bush administration, roughly seven thousand American soldiers will be dead by the end of this (if things continue going "smoothly" - hah.)</p>

<p>I sent out an email earlier tonight with a pdf attachment. I got an article from my mother. It is regarding the job market for recent college graduates. It does a fairly effective job of illustrating how this administration has (perhaps fatally?) sent us careening off a cliff. And this gentleman does a fine job of giving us a frightening example of a potential future - a government whose primary concern is the desperate policing of its citizens. If you didn't receive the email (I sent it out to most people I talk to...) you can find it <a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/misc/2003.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>This conveniently ties back into my previous topic about Rome. I don't want to be an alarmist, but I am becoming convinced that we may be closer to our ultimate demise than we believe. Financial chaos is always the first step in declines. The Bush Administration has done a remarkable job in setting up record deficits that are set to continue for the forseeable future. We could very well see an entire financial collapse of our government. What would happen then? Well it won't be pretty. For anyone. </p>

<p>One wonders how we can have a deficit with a $10.668 trillion GDP...</p>

<p>Ah, but then one remembers the outright pillaging this current government is doing to our finances.</p>

<p>This is a sad time to be an American.</p>

            <p>Couldn't agree more Nick; On a smaller scale, it's somewhat similar, financially speaking anyway, to what's happening in Massachusetts - Romney's a typical Republican who really has no clue what he's doing.  I haven't heard a single good comment about him lately.</p>

<p>Bush, of course, is a whole other problem.  I will be sorely disappointed in the American public if he's reelected in 2004.  A year or two ago, post-September 11th, I would have said it was inevitable, but thankfully the current administration's gross indiscretions are finally coming to light, slowly but surely.</p>

            <p>That article you sent me is chilling.  But I wouldn't go so far as saying that the decline of America is coming, atleast not yet.  In the past we've hit new milestone high's in deficits and problems, and we've always come out, though with history on our side we won't come out til we're 45.  I guess what it comes down to in the end for us is to be smart with our money and smart with our voting, and keep numbskulls like bush out of office.  Unfortunately, midwest and southern america isn't exactly all for that.  The best part about this whole thing is how bush received faulty information from the CIA about Iraq trying to get uranium i believe from africa.  And how now they're like "oops, sorry i guess not" and they are blaming the CIA directior for it.  They most likely knew this all along, they acted before someone could catch on, and they did what they wanted to do, completely handicap saddam's regime once and for all, and implement a soon to be democracy to one of the fo<br />
rmer power nations in the mid east.  They sent a message to all the extremists about what they can do on a large scale, but it's only going to stir more terrorist attempts and extremist movements in the end.  Well, might as well head to walmart and pick up that AK-47 i've had my eye on.<br />

            <p>I would say that the United States has successfully shown what it can do militarily. Perhaps al-Qaeda doubted what we could do? I don't know. I don't really think that's central.</p>

<p>You know what I find interesting, it was one of al-Qaeda's goals to have our troops removed from Saudi Arabia... has anyone noticed that this happened already? We announced that we are leaving Saudi Arabia. I'm not a fan of the Saudis in general (how could one be a fan of an autocratic absolute monarchy?) but I find this to be similar to the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis - the Soviets remove their missiles from Cuba and we move our missiles from Turkey. </p>

<p>That being said, I agree with you Jim, thankfully as we get closer to the election it appears Bush's popularity is shrinking. I refuse to vote for Senator Kerry, even though he's a local product. He voted to give Bush the powers of war. "That's a no no too, Daffy."</p>

            <p>did you see simon schama and niall ferguson on "NOW" two fridays ago? it was brilliant. although niall was on his usual "empire good" rant. of course we have trillions just waiting to be spent to build + maintain nations when ours is sadly decaying. </p>

<p>you're joking right? economists said the recession was over in novembe r 2001!  guess this means we're in a depression..</p>

<p>the problem with our economy (this coming from an economic dunce) is that it's heavily reliant on consumer spending.  $pend $pend $pend; like people don't already own enough shit they don't need. </p>

<p>we're always weary of the consumer index and the tenths of a percentage point it either climbs or falls... how are people supposed to spend, if they haven't got a)money or b)a job or c)both? </p>

<p>rant over.  soz.</p>
