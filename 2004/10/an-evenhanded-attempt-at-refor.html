            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/norton_fightclub.jpg" align="left" hspace="4">In the Vice Presidential debate on October 5th, John Edwards, on the topic of tort reform and frivolous lawsuits introduced an interesting proposal to reduce the amount of lawsuits (thereby reducing liabilities and ideally premiums) that hit corporations across many sectors, notably health care.</p>

<p>"<i>John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it. We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases.</i></p>

<p><i>That way we keep the cases out of the system that don't belong in the system. They talk about frivolous cases. We believe cases that don't belong in the system should never be in the system.</i>"</p>

<p>This is a bit of a follow up to an earlier post <a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/000402.html">"The question of 'wealth"</a> which took on interesting form in the comments regarding the relationship between health care costs and tort reform. </p>

<p>So far, Edwards's proposal is the most appealing I've heard. I agree that overweight people should not be able to sue McDonalds and that if you spill hot coffee on yourself, you are simply bumbling and clumsy, not an instant litigant. And I find it considerably suspect how multi-million dollar payouts magically heal "emotional damage." My concerns, however, arise from the potential restriction of a person's ability to seek a redress of grievances that some of the more pro-corporate reform proposals represent.</p>

            <p>I like the idea on the surface, but as you mention, I think it will lock out far too many cases that would have merit upon discovery to say that any independent council could pick out all the loser cases. I heard a long time ago about a system I think used in Europe, maybe the UK, I forget, but basically it is loser pays. So if you bring a suit against someone, and lose you pay the costs associated. Of coarse there would need to be a way to prevent a major corporation from outlawyering the case and charging the full expense back to the original claimant.  Obviously there are no easy outs here. As you said, the monetary reward relieving all emotional damage just seems insane to me. Because of this, I must disagree with the Edwards proposal in favor of a restriction on punitive damage awards.  I also think there are laws on the books now that do what Edwards proposes in terms of punishment against lawyers for bringing frivolous lawsuits, but they are rarely followed up on.</p>

            <p>I hope you aren't agreeing with the outcome of the spilled coffee case.</p>

<p>There was another one like that. A guy bought a motor home. He set it on cruise control, got out of the drivers seat and went to the bathroom. After the thing crashed he sued saying that the drivers manual never stated cruise control doesn't control stearing. He won.</p>

            <p>This is an issue on which I clearly fault the "victim." </p>

<p>In many cases, such as the McDonalds obesity case, the coffee case and this motor home case, the courts are simply rewarding stupidity. Obviously this is not fair to the corporations. We just need to restore a semblance of common sense into these judgements. </p>

<p>Honestly. Like how McDonalds had to put "Caution: the beverage you're about to enjoy is extremely hot!" on their cups... is that really going to stop someone from accidentally boiling their leg? You ordered hot coffee you idiot! They should find in favor of you finally getting that GED!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately (or perhaps I should say fortunately, as we're all guilty of it from time to time), stupidity is not illegal.  The question is if the courts applied the reasonableness principle or a subjective idea of reasonableness...I still think McDonald's should be liable if it makes coffee hot enough to burn someone so severely as to require medical treatment.  What if instead of spilling it, she had simply taken a sip of it?  Isn't it reasonable to assume that a hot coffee, despite it's being "hot," should necessarily be served at a safely consumable temperature (as consumption is its purpose and goal)?</p>

<p>As for the cruise control example...well, the automobile company should have had the foresight to adequately explain the function and purpose of cruise control.  One could say that practically speaking a person with a decent knowledge of automobiles would understand that cruise control does not control steering, but that particular person, reading from the manual, which is supposedly a reliable and comprehensive source of information about that particular vehicle, apparently (as far as his complaint is concerned) reasonably inferred that cruise control did indeed automatically pilot his vehicle in all respects?</p>

<p>Courts often find, when discussing reasonableness, that one "should have known" something.  I would argue that this is too specific and technical an issue to assume knowledge on the part of the hypothetical "reasonable person."  Moreover, idiosyncratic plaintiffs change the rules: what if he had never driven a car before?  The court would be punishing the plaintiff, effectively, for an innocent naivete in trusting the auto manual to sufficiently explain the usage of that particular feature....</p>

            <p>No, I can see under no circumstance anyone thinking cruise control ment autopilot. I think that most everyone else would agree. If the case is that we have to fully explain everything our products DO NOT DO, manuals would grow to rediculous sizes, and cases would ensue saying the manual was too big for the reasonable person to have read the warning about not washing the outer engine with gasoline just before smoking a cigarette and droping the match into the enigine compartment. </p>

            <p>Policy-wise, I would tend to agree with you.  I'm just trying to look at it how a court might.</p>

<p>It depends, ultimately, I suppose, on the precise language of the manual itself.  If it said "Cruise control, when activated, will automatically maintain a set speed without depression of the gas pedal," then it's pretty clear that it certainly DOES NOT control steering as well.  </p>

<p>But what if the language is more vague?  If it says "Cruise control functions automatically to maintain operation of the vehicle" or something equally ambiguous, it wouldn't be too hard to argue that it could not be reasonably inferred that steering was not  included in this function.</p>

<p>I'm beating a dead horse here, I realize.  The best answer is that a reasonable person probably would know that a car cannot drive itself.  Even in the case of an idiosyncratic plaintiff (one who had never driven before), you'd need to prove knowledge of this idiosyncracy on the part of the defendants.  </p>

<p>The point is that lawsuits that make it to trial are from a legal standpoint never "stupid," in the absence of a serious flaw in the legal system.  Cases at trial have already established a viable legal basis for argument, or they would not have gotten that far.</p>

Two things.</p>

<p>One, I'm very suspicious of these proposed "independent experts."  I suppose  what they mean, from a legal perspective, is that other legal experts would examine cases  to see whether a viable cause of action exists...As DA said, it's very unlikely that  these "experts" could accurately predict the viability of a case in the discovery or pre-trial phases.</p>

<p>Moreover, every citizen has a right to his day in court.  This is what courts do: separate the wheat from the chaff, the winners from the losers.  As long as a party has a viable cause of action and some sufficient evidence to back up that cause of action, a court must hear the case.  Keep in mind that true frivolous lawsuits rarely if ever reach trial, as they will typically be resolved via settlement (97% of cases are settled out of court).  Additionally, any first year law student is capable of recognizing when a case does not have a real cause of action: cases like these are resolved in motions to dismiss.</p>

<p>Two, the American lega<br />
l system takes "emotional damages," as you term them, very seriously.  There is an entire section of tort law dedicated to the intentional infliction of emotional distress.  When a party successfully proves that they have suffered emotional distress, the courts compensate them in the only way they can: monetarily.  A court cannot undo the emotional harm done to a person, but it can see that that person is compensated financially for their suffering.</p>

<p>Remember that what may seem silly on the surface often has far more fundamental legal aspects to it than its appearance makes obvious.  </p>

<p>A person getting severely burned from spilt coffee might seem like simply a klutz, but in legal terms,  one could argue (and this is a quick and dirty version) that a reasonable person (the crux of many legal arguments) would certainly not expect  McDonald's coffee to be hot enough to cause serious injury and that McDonald's was negligent in heating it to such an extent.</p>

<p>Note also that legal representation is extraordinarily expensive, and any case that gets to trial has already cost the  parties thousands upon thousands of dollars, so your average person is going to be  very reluctant and in fact incapable of litigating "frivolous" claims.</p>

<p>If a case makes it to trial, it is not frivolous, by legal standpoints.  As for lawsuits that don't, any skilled and honest lawyer (flame away), though they be at the mercy of their client, will do their best to see that the case is settled as efficiently as possible.</p>
