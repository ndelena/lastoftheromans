<p>"I will be disappointed. But democracy is democracy," Bush said. Not surprisingly Bush draws no distinction between "democracy" and "theocracy." In an Arab world that is increasingly poorer, younger, and more radical, don't we run the risk of creating another Taliban-style Iraq? What exactly are the implications of an "Islamic Iraq" - Sharia law? The Islamists may come to power in the <b>first</b> and <b>last</b> free election in Iraq. We'd effectively be giving the keys away to al-Qaeda. </p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> The latest polls in Iraq show religious leaders in the lead for the country's January election. From MSNBC: "<i>Leaders of Iraq's religious parties have emerged as the country's most popular politicians and would win the largest share of votes if an election were held today, while the U.S.-backed government of interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi is losing serious ground, according to a U.S.-financed poll by the International Republican Institute.</i>"</p>

<p>In another interesting note, 45% of Iraqis feel their country is heading in the wrong direction. That's actually less than the 56% of Americans that feel their country is heading in the wrong direction.</p>

            <p>I disagree with the President. It needs to be a democratic government, not a theocracy. If the Islamists were to come to power "democratically" I think it would be up to us and a coalition to remove them from power.  The Iraqi people need to be educated as to what government would serve them best, and why the Islamists are wrong. I believe this can be done ... but probably not in time for January elections.</p>

<p>Theocracies are not stable governments, and they are not peaceful and they pose a significant threat to world peace. We need to make sure that when there are elections in Iraq that a truly democratic, secular government takes over. Iran is next.</p>

<p>As an aside, I attended an excellant AIPAC event last night in Chestnut Hill that highlighted why Israel is so important to the U.S. and why the world should not wait, or encourage, Israel to  "go it alone" in Iran. We need to create a coalition and go after the problem head on, not militarily, but other ways.</p>

<p>The speakers gave a great analysis of France. They want Israel to deal with Iran alone for 3 reasons:<br />
1) It takes care of a nuclear threat that would threaten France within 1-3 years.<br />
2) It allows France to continue to profit from Iran.<br />
3) It allows them to enjoy the benefits of such action, while at the same time  condemn and criticize Israel, which they love to do.</p>

<p>As a college student, funds are scarce and I rarely give to candidates, PACs, or anything. But so far AIPAC has $100 of my money, and I think it will receive much more in the coming months and years. I recommend all of you visiting www.aipac.org and contributing. BTW - Their New England Youth Chapter is hosting an Election Night party in Boston (at the Roxy I believe).</p>

            <p>Bush is full of shit.  Any American President is full of shit when they say that they will support democracy no matter what type of government foreign free elections produce: look at Chile.  </p>

<p>Salvador Allende was a democratically elected socialist president.  Then he made the mistake of nationalizing industry, consequently pissing off corporate America....and we subsequently supported Pinochet's military junta, in which Allende was murdered.  American military representatives were present in Chile during the junta.</p>

<p>American does not support democracy.</p>

            <p>That said, perhaps I should rephrase.  It may well be that Bush will support a theocracy: (1) he practically runs one himself, and (2) the U.S. has always been more comfortable supporting a dictator who keeps the oil supplies running freely.</p>

            <p>"he practically runs one himself" - What the heck does that mean?</p>

<p>"the U.S. has always been more comfortable supporting a dictator who keeps the oil supplies running freely" - why must even the smartest, most intelligent liberals always go back to an oil arguement that is so shallow, so untrue, and makes the person appear to be an uneducated liberal college student.</p>

<p>The "Bush Doctrine" and the neocon way of thinking goes against this philosophy ... the way these two things are successful is by bringing democracy to undemocratic countries. The reasoning is that democratic countries do not attack or threaten other democratic countries. Dictatorships work against this world view whether oil is involved or not.</p>

            <p>Because oil is at the base of it all Ryan, however cliche it may be at this point (due primarily to shallow liberals and celebrities perpetuating the "no blood for oil" slogan).</p>

<p>The simple question defining this argument is would we be in Iraq if it did not contain one of the largest crude oil supplies in the world?  Would we have gone in 15 or so years ago?</p>

<p>I tend to doubt it.</p>

            <p>Again...in Chile, the U.S. government voluntarily aided a dictator in dest<br />
roying a democratically elected government, because that government had the audacity to think that it could use its nation's industry in the way it saw fit.</p>

<p>This is not a case of Bush nobly invoking the Monroe Doctrine and heralding the birth of a new democracy.  This is pure self-interest and disregard for international law (ask any international law expert).  Foreign policy  has historically been necessarily more Machiavellian than domestic, but this does not mean we can wage a first-strike invasion against another country: whether it be for the purposes of dictating democracy (naive and hopeless in itself), or for the more realistic purposes of securing our foreign oil supply and keeping prices in check.</p>

            <p>How is the separation of church and state is so definitive in the American Government when it never mede the cut into the constitution. The language was used before the constitution was written but the first Amendment is a far cry from a complete removeal of faith from society the libs would like to see. I find Kerry's beliefs insane when they come to abortion, but his pandering to both sides on the issue is never questioned by the left. He has said he believes life begins at conception, but supports a womans right to abort that life. The only translation is that he supports murder in the case of abortion. It is one thing to believe that there is no life until a certain point in the pregnancy or until birth, but a different story when you say there is life. Kind of a round about way to say it is impossible to separate religion from a person in public life. My beliefs in God will always shape my decisions and opinions and I would expect that anyperson that wants to wavetheir supposed beliefs around in my face would vote those same beliefs in congress.</p>

            <p>Allow me to quote a few excerpts from a rather important government document:</p>

<p>"...no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."  Art. VI, cl. 3</p>

<p>" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." Amendment I</p>

<p>Said document is the  U.S. Constitution.  While "separation of church and state" is not expressly written therein, the above sections certainly preclude any such arrangement.</p>

            <p>I'm definitely behind Jim on this issue.</p>

<p>I add to his argument: "I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state." - Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>Even during the morning hours of our nation there was great religious pluralism across the thirteen states. The reason why we must separate religion from governance (aside from the fact that religion is folly) is simply because it is unjust to legislate one's own faith over those who do not share it. The constitution protects against this explicitly.</p>

            <p>Nick, you are much smarter than this. You know better than to quote that Jefferson letter. I highly recommend you and Jim read this article, as it debunks that once and for all:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=9" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=9" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=9</a></a></a></p>

<p>In addition, those quotes from the Constitution say nothing about a seperation of church and state. They say that A) there is to be no established religion and B) and that no one should be kept from public office for their religious faith. There is a freedom of religion in America, not a freedom from religion. That wall of seperation is a myth that has been perpetuated for so long that most Americans now actually believe it to be real.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I must completely agree with DA. John Kerry makes no sense whatsoever in his stance on abortion, and in fact I write about this in my latest column found at the still under construction website: www.ryanboehm.com</p>

<p>If a person's religious beliefs and belief in God does not come into play during decision making, what kind of faith is that? If I were ever to get elected to anything, my faith would govern my decisions for sure. For it to not would be turning my back on my Faith and my God. This issue is so black & white, I find it so hard to comprehend the other side. I am not telling you to have a faith, I am saying that my faith governs my life and therefore that is the only way that I can govern.</p>

            <p>A few quotes from the so-called "least Christian" of the Founding Fathers, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>ìWork as if you were to live 100 years; pray as if you were to die tomorrow.î  ~ Benjamin Franklin in his book, Poor Richardís Almanac, May 1757</p>

<p>"Let us therefore rely upon the goodness of the Cause, and the aid of the supreme Being, in whose hands Victory is, to animate and encourage us to great and noble Actions."  --George Washington </p>

<p>"Done...the seventeenth day of September, in the year of our LORD one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven."  --Closing line of the U.S. Constitution</p>

<p>"It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible" ~ George Washington</p>

<p>"In the ... contest with Great Britain ... we had daily prayer in this room for divine protection. Our prayers, sir, were heard, and Ö graciously answered. Ö And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? Or do we imagine we no long need His assistance?î -Dr. Benjamin Franklin as recorded by James Madison in 1787</p>

            <p>Those unable to view the world through anything but the (flawed) lens of religious dogma  are inherently unsuited for democratic office.  Your view of the constitution is that of Justices Scalia and Thomas: one of strict construction, a system of constitutional analysis that is naive, limited in scope, and ultimately useless as a continuing source of governance.</p>

<p>The Constitution does not have to expressly include the words "separation of church and state" for one to exist, just as it does not have to include the word "privacy" for an inherent right to privacy to exist.  The Constitution is a living, flexible document that is meant to adapt to the changing world.  </p>

<p>There is a "freedom of religion" but not a "freedom from religion," Ryan?  I exercise my right of freedom from religion every day, by ignoring it almost completely.  I'm sure that under your biased beliefs, though I doubt you'd ever come out and say it, atheism should be generally frowned upon if not prohibited entirely.  As an American, I have a right to not be accosted by the religious beliefs of others, whether that be a function of "freedom of" or "freedom from."</p>

<p>I have a right to have a leader who does not make his decisions based solely upon the one-sided moral basis of Christian thought.  I have a right to not be told I am subject to eternal damnation for not being a practicing Catholic who believes in God.</p>

<p>I declare my freedom from religion, just as I declare your freedom of religion, just as I declare my right not to be ruled by a theocrat.</p>

<p>You make this statement on the belief that there is a right to privacy in the constitution. There is no such right and I think it would be wise for you to check out Robert Bork's , The Tempting of America.  He does a great job laying out the follies of the Supreme court on issues from both sides of the aisle concerning the courts wrongly argued decisions.</p>

<p>You also could not be more wrong in your statement that the constitution is a flexible document. The constitution is living in the sense that it can be amended, but it is inflexible in meaning of intent. </p>

<p>You are also flawed in belief that leaders are forcing their religion down our throat. The majority of the American public believes in some God. We elect our leaders based on our beliefs and how we think the candidate will value our beliefs. If a candidate matches our beliefs in God, as well as other factors we vote for that candidate having the full intention that those values and beliefs will be carried into public life and that the they will help instill the morals that stem from those beliefs. To expect leaders to completely disconnect from religious beliefs is futile. It is not possible to separate from your decision process a belief in values  when those values guide your everyday life.  </p>

<p>The only<br />
 possible way to remove all aspects of religion is to only elect leaders that have no belief in a religion, completely disregarding our freedom of religion. You can declare your freedom from religion all you want, just vote for the atheist, there is usually one running.</p>

            <p>Ryan, Benjamin Franklin was probably the most religious of the founding fathers. Either way, I respect and (in a handful, only a handful of cases) admire people who have strong personal faith. But the matter should not and cannot be legislated onto others. </p>

<p>Kerry's position on abortion may be illogical, but on the same token, so is deriving one's own set of personal ethics from the bible. </p>

<p>I must quote from The West Wing episode "The Midterms." President Bartlett confronts a conservative Talk Radio host:</p>

<p>Bartlett: "I like how you call homosexuality an abomination." <br />
Jacobs: "I don't say homosexuality is an abomination, Mr. President. The Bible does." <br />
Bartlett: "Yes, it does. Leviticus." <br />
Jacobs: "18:22." <br />
Bartlett: "Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here. I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, always cleared the table when it was her turn. What would be a good price for her? While thinking about that, can I ask another? My chief of staff, Leo McGarry, insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important because we have a lot of sports fans in this town: touching the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean. Leviticus 11:7 If they promise to wear gloves can the Washington Redskins still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads? Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be mistaking this for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tight-Ass Club, in this building, when the President stands, nobody sits."</p>

            <p>It is absolutely and completely irrelevant what a private citizen said in a privately published book concerning the meaning and intent of the Constitution. </p>

<p>In the United States of America, according to the said document itself, the Supreme Court of the United States  are the final and ultimate arbiters of the interpretation of the Constitution.  The Constitution IS what they say it is, until they say different.  This is a simple, straightforward, fundamental principle of American government.</p>

<p>And the Supreme Court has said that there is indeed a right to privacy in the federal constitution.  See Roe v. Wade.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is not above the constitution. It is decisions like Roe that show a complete disregard for the constitution, and base judgement on what the majority FELT about the issue rather than what the constitution  is in place to do. This is most evident in the awful Michigan decision in which O'Conner says they think there is a need for racial profiling in admissions, but only for the next 10 years or so.  There is either the right to make admission decisions based on race or there isn't. If there is, that right won't fade in 10 years unless the constitution is amended between now and then. The is no right to privacy since I am still unable to commit suicide legally. I do not think I should have that right, but I do think it is the ultimate private decision, but the court has taken that right away. Let's all get a clue. The court reads into the constitution what they feel appropriate at the time. When they are uncertain as to how to get the result they want through reasoning, they throw out simple citation to other cases, often not related in the least to that case. Countless cases following Brown blindly sited that case simply saying 'See Brown v. Board of Education.' The only problem with this is that the follow up cases had nothing to do with publicly funded schools. </p>

<p>The entire point of our legal system relies on precedent.  In some cases that precedent goes back to English law. The intent of the laws passed are clear at the time they are written, and that clarity does not fade in time. We elect legislatures to change the laws as the times require. The court needs to rely on that intent in order to remain impartial.</p>

            <p>It is one thing to say that you agree or disagree with a particular Supreme Court decision, it's an entirely different thing to attempt to undermine the fact that the Court's interpretation of the Constitution is LAW, and is the meaning of the Constitution as far as all courts within its jurisdiction are concerned.  (And as we know, when it comes to interpreting the Constitution, all courts must defer to the Supreme Court.)</p>

<p>In Roe v. Wade the right of privacy was established in regard to abortion.  Perhaps I should have specified that.  The fact remains however, that the Court has identified that this right exi<br />
sts in this capacity, and Roe v. Wade is at this point still good law.  Just because they have decided differently in regards to a right to commit suicide does not destroy the  right's existence, it merely narrows what the right of privacy applies to.  </p>

<p>Just because the Supreme Court overrules itself and changes decisions on issues from time to time does not mean that those decisions are not law; the Constitution's meaning changes as the Supreme Court interprets it.   </p>

<p>Let's take your example of admissions based on race.  It's completely irrelevant that the current applicable decision might change in ten years. Now, and until the Court does change it, the correct interpretation of the Constitution is what the Court has last decided it to be.</p>

<p>This is why the Constitution is flexible; through the power of the Court to definitively interpret it, the document reflects the current era in which it resides.  I'm not saying that the Supreme Court's always right, as clearly that isn't true: they're human, they've made bad decisions before, and they will again.  </p>

<p>But the undeniable, concrete fact of the matter is, the Constitution of the United States , at any given time, means precisely what the Supreme Court has interpreted it to mean, neither more nor less, for better or for worse.  This is the law, the bedrock of our legal system, and not a single law professor would disagree with this statement.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what you or I think the Constitution means is irrelevant, because it is the opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court that matters.  If you disagree with this, I'm sorry to say, you're simply and factually wrong.</p>

            <p>Note that judicial review is limited to cases that are presented to the Court for adjudication; the Supreme Court cannot just reach out and dub something unconstitutional.  (Unlike some countries in Europe, interestingly).</p>

<p>You are correct in saying that the Court is not above the Constitution, but the fact remains that it's interpretation of it is law.  The Court cannot change the Constitution, but they can interpret what is written and implied therein.</p>

            <p>It is not the decision that matters in these cases. Had there been a legal basis for coming to the decision there would be no arguement. The justices have the obligation to interpret the constitution. However, when the justices refuse to use the materials at hand to come to an outcome but instead come to an outcome and try to find materials that would support their stance it is the obligation of the legislature to begin impeachment procedings to prevent those justices from making law. Historically this has rarly been attempted, but that does not mean we shouldn't proceed with this action when the time arrises. </p>

<p>That time has come for Margaret Marshallhere in Mass. It has also come for a number of supreme court justices, namely those that supported the Michigan decision that laughed in the face of 228 years of legal reasoningand precedent, and blatently agreed with an opinion that 1) supported racism specifically denounced in the amendments, and 2) outlined the feelings of O'Conner  thoughout the opinion. </p>

<p>The right to privacy was found in the constitution in  Griswold v. Connecticut.</p>

            <p>Just a quick comment before I head off to get drunk while watching Game 7 ... The Constitution gives the Congress the right to limit the power of the Judiciary, including the Supreme Court. In fact right now Congress is debating a bill that would take cases pertaining to "under God" in the pledge away from the Courts. In addition, things such as the 10 commandments in public buildings and other instances of religion in the public square, would also be removed from the jurisdiction of the court. The court does not have the final say, and the Founders were just as scared about tyranny of judges as they were against the tyranny of England.</p>

            <p>You're missing the point.  The fact is that it is still law.  Should the legislature decide to attempt to amend the Constitution, it can do so.  Impeachment proceedings are an option, but the likelihood of that happening is low, as believe it or not,  just as many people would agree with me as with you two neo-conservatives here.</p>

<p>The argument DA is making is the same old banal "activist judges" argument that George Bush has been ineloquently making throughout his entire tenure.  </p>

<p>One of the many problems with a strict constructionist viewpoint is that give it a few decades and the Constitution  will already be becoming dated; a living, flexible interpretation of the law allows for technological, ideological, and governmental changes.</p>

<p>I love that the neo-cons purport to be the last bastion of true Americanism, and yet they refuse to acknowledge how the judicial system works.   Foolish political and religious beliefs crowd your viewpoints.</p>

<p>Rather than simply say you disagree with the way the Supreme Court has decided a case, you would rather audaciously presume that you know better than the Court and the government itself how the judicial system works.  </p>

<p>The problems you have are not with activist judges, they are with a document that is fundamentally liberal: one that for the most part defends the rights of the people rather than restricts them.  You don't like the fact that the Supreme Court thinks that the Ten Commandments are inappropriate decor for a public government facility because you think in doing so the Court is restricting your rights, when in fact it is upholding the rights of EVERYONE to be free from a government influenced one way or another by religion. </p>

<p>The first amendment protection against laws protecting the freedom of religion and prohibiting the establishment of a state religion LOGICALLY REQUIRE that the government therefore not display BLATANT SYMBOLS OF RELIGION UPON THE WALLS OF ITS SEATS OF POWER.  A child could understand this, and yet you refuse to.  Fortunately, not everyone is religious, and just because you are foolishly of the opinion that you are "right" does not mean that you are, or that others should have to live in the shadow of your dictated standards of faith.  </p>

<p>I'm not demanding that the government declare itself atheist -- why should you be able to argue that it should declare itself god-fearing?  The absence of religion in government is precisely what the Founders intended, because it can then democratically represent all citizens without bias and simultaneously allow them to have their own peronal beliefs without imposing them on others.  </p>

<p>And I tell you right now, I am personally extraordinarily offended by the imposition of religious beliefs upon.  I am imposed upon everytime I hear "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance or see "In God We Trust" on the dollar bill, because in that moment I understand that I'm not truly being represented as a valid member of this society -- merely because I don't believe in some mythical man in the sky.  It's ludicrous.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court protects the rights of all by interpreting the Constitution, and just because a man who received Cs in college, who is not qualified in any respect to understand the Constitution as defined by its text and the two centuries of case law interpreting that text says that the Supreme Court is not doing its job correctly certainly does not mean its true.</p>

<p>And as happy as it would make you, Ryan, to see the legislature attempt to take these religious issues out of the Court's hands, it would ultimately be futile: it is most certainly an unconstitutional measure, and the Court would eventually rule it so, thus negating it.  Short of an amendment to the Constitution itself, the legislature cannot dictate what is and is not  within the Supreme Court's power to review, one of many delightful checks and balances that I'm sure piss you off to no end.</p>

            <p>(Wish is could take credit for the following, but he explains if far better than I could ever)</p>

<p>Congress has great control over the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution provides that "[t]he judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." It is well-established that since Congress has total discretion over whether to create the lower federal courts, it also has great discretion over the jurisdiction of those courts it chooses to create. In fact, Congress has in the past withdrawn jurisdiction from the lower federal courts when it became dissatisfied with their performance or concluded that state courts were the better forum for certain types of cases. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld Congress's power to do so. </p>

<p>Congress also has some authority to l<br />
imit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and to regulate its activities. Article III of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court "shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make."  Although we recognize that the scope of Congress's power to regulate and restrict the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over particular types of cases is under debate, there is a constitutional basis for this authority.</p>

            <p>Congress can regulate via statute, provided said statues are themselves constitutional.  A statute intimately addressing the Supreme Court's capacity to consider an issue of freedom of religion would not be so.</p>

<p>Case law is law filling in the gaps left by legislation, which could not reasonably cover every scenario under our legal system.  Certainly, case law can be overruled by congressional statute.  But while Congress cannot pass an unconstitutional law; it will not be upheld by the judiciary.  </p>

<p>Just as Congress could not pass a federal statute that stated "the national religion shall be Christianity," they cannot pass a law stating that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over cases arising under issues of religion.  Such statutes would be inherently unconstitutional.  Practically speaking, if the Congress was actually naive enough to pass such laws. they would go into effect...only to be shot down by the Supreme Court, under the concept of judicial review - one of our checks and balances - as soon as a case was brought contesting them.</p>

<p>That aside...I'm not sure I understand why it matters so much.  Is it important to your personal faith that that faith be represented on the dollar bill and in the pledge of allegiance?  Is your belief in your god so shallow that it must needs be publicly announced and supported by official propaganda?  Be satisfied that you have the absolute right to practice your religion in safety and privacy, and don't be so concerned about whether others agree with you.</p>

            <p>JC, Completely apart from this, I have Glannon's Civ Pro tapes on CD in MP3 format if you are interested.  I learned Civ Pro through the tapes since my teacher was awful. Also, buy any study aid written by Glannon whether you have him or not. They come in handy. The Examples and explanations series is generally really good.</p>

            <p>Yeah I've got the E&E books for most of my classes, they're really good, particularly for reference in areas one has trouble with in class.  </p>

<p>I have Perlman for Civ. Pro.; he's generally pretty good.  I guess there's actually an acknowledgment to him in the Glannon book.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
