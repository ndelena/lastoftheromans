            <p><i>BOSTON, Massachusetts (AP) -- Hoping to bring capital punishment to Massachusetts, Gov. Mitt Romney is preparing to file a death penalty bill early next year that he says is so carefully written it will guarantee only the guilty are executed.</i></p>

<p><i>Based in part on the findings of a death penalty panel he appointed, the bill would limit capital punishment to the "worst of the worst" crimes including terrorism, the murder of police officers, murder involving torture and the killing of witnesses. It also would use evidence such as DNA testing to protect the innocent.</i></p>

<p><i>Romney wants his death penalty bill to be a model for other states.</i></p>

<p>On October 1, 1997 Jeffrey Curley, an 11 year old boy, was kidnapped from his Cambridge neighborhood, several blocks from MIT. After refusing to take part in sexual intercourse with his kidnappers, he was suffocated. His body was molested and then immersed in a lime and cement-filled container and thrown into the Great Works River in South Berwick, Maine. </p>

<p>This horrific crime, unprecedented in Massachusetts history, ignited a firestorm among concerned parents and citizens. Then-Governor Paul Cellucci, a Republican, stoked the flames in the State Legislature as a capital punishment reinstatement measure came to vote. </p>

<p>Cellucci was confident that the measure would pass, but on the day of the vote, Representative John P. Slattery, a 39-year-old 2nd-term Democrat from Peabody, informed his colleagues that he had rethought his support of the measure, and intended to vote no, in line with his conscience. This came only a week after he joined the razor thin House majority in favor of the measure. </p>

<p>Slatteryís decision condemned the measure to failure in an 80-80 tie vote. The public firestorm soon quieted, but Cellucciís desire to reinstate capital punishment in Massachusetts remained constant. </p>

<p>On March 29, 1999, the measure was again brought before the House. It failed 80-73. </p>

<p>Lt. Gov Jane Swift became Massachusettsí acting governor when Paul Cellucci was appointed Ambassador to Canada by President Bush in early 2001. She continued her predecessorís drive for capital punishment and on March 12, 2001 yet another vote was taken in the Massachusetts House. It was soundly rejected by a vote of 94-60.</p>

<p>The last execution in Massachusetts took place on May 9, 1947. Since then, it has largely become one of the more unreceptive places in the United States for capital punishment. Northeastern University Professor James Alan Fox, a scholar on the death penalty attributes this to the stateís liberal and well-educated populace.</p>

<p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/death-penalty-sign02.jpg" align="left" hspace="4">Current Governor Mitt Romney partly believes he was elected for his campaign promise to reinstate the death penalty. He recently announced the formation of a special panel of experts to determine whether a legal and forensic standard can be established to eliminate the risk of wrongful executions. Under his plan, three categories of homicides will warrant the death penalty: those associated with terrorism, the killing of police officers, prosecutors, judges or trial witnesses, and heinous crimes, such as multiple killings.</p>

<p>Romneyís nascent effort goes against the national tide; in 2000 Illinois Governor George Ryan announced a moratorium on executions after 13 people on death row were found -- through new DNA and other evidence -- to have been wrongly convicted. Since then, death penalty study commissions have been undertaken in Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Federal system, to determine whether justice is truly being done by capital punishment. </p>

<p>There is no arguable need for the death penalty in Massachusetts. The Bay State, with the third highest population density in the U.S., currently has the lowest crime rate of any urbanized state. The greater Boston area, with some three and a half million residents, is the safest metropolitan area in the country. Gov. Romney is under the impression that after the establishment of a costly forensic laboratory, the people of Massachusetts - who are already largely against the death penalty ñ will somehow become capital converts. Not only is this counterintuitive, it approaches insulting. Moreover, evidence ñ from the FBI no less ñ dispels the myth that capital punishment is a crime deterrent. </p>

<p>The three leading states where police officers were feloniously killed in 1998 were California, the state with the highest death row population; Texas, the state with the most executions since 1976; and Florida, the state that is third highest in executions and in death row population. (<i>FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, 1998</i>)</p>

<p>Among the southern states, which comprise 85% of executions in America, we find the top 3 murder rates in the nation (held by Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, respectively). </p>

<p>Currently, the following states do not have death penalty statutes: Alaska, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>A respectable majority of 112 nations have abolished the death penalty. Among Americaís European allies, all have abandoned capital punishment. Even countries such as Angola, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkmenistan have struck down state executions. This places the United States in league w<br />
ith countries such as China, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Vietnam. In fact, in 2002, 81% of known executions took place in China, Iran and the United States.</p>

<p>America can claim no moral high ground in this matter.</p>

<p>Even the father of young Jeffrey Curley, Robert Curley, once an ardent supporter of Cellucciís reinstatement goals, has now changed his mind on the death penalty. In 2001, Curley addressed a conference organized by Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation (MVFR): ìI learned more about the death penalty, some of the problems with it, and I changed my mind.î</p>

<p>If this man, so burdened with the grief of the past, can desire to support more responsible and humane means of justice, surely that should serve as a notice not only to Governor Romney, but to the powers that be in Washington: there will be no death penalty in Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>I respectfully disagree...</p>

<p>My disagreement isn't so much with your argument that the death penalty is wrong, or even whether or not Romney will be successful in bringing it to the wonderful citizens of the Commonwealth...</p>

<p>I disagree with your inability to see the other side.  I might not personally agree with the death penalty, but I can see why people (the relatives of a homicide victim) may want it.  Although it is my personal opinion that the decision of whether someone lives or dies should never be determined by another human (either in court or on the streets), none of us can really speak until we lose a relative or loved one to a "heinous crime."  </p>

<p>By telling people what they should think/feel/do by emphasizing our (liberals) superior intelligence and education; we inevitably push people away (see: Election 2004).  </p>

<p>So what I suggest we offer is an understanding.  An understanding to those who have lost loved ones in a brutal manner.  We can throw all the numbers and facts we want at people, but this argument comes down to raw emotion.  Emotions not held by Romney, Bush or any other policymaker; but rather the emotions help by the likes of Robert Curley and countless others.  I can understand why Mr. Curley would initially want his son's murderers to be killed (and I commend him even more for seeing the flaws in the system), that is something you have yet to admit.  </p>

<p>Although It is the job of lawmakers and politicians to not act on emotions (See: Patriot Act), they should also be able to understand the feelings of those they represent.  By imposing a stubborn "I'm-smarter-than-you-do-what-I-say" elitist view on everything from the death penalty to foreign policy; we are pushing more and more people away from the great ideas we have.</p>

<p>(Note:  I am against the death penalty in its current format, I would prefer to see it used in very rare cases where only the family of the victim agrees it is necessary)</p>

            <p>There are a few things I never understood about the left and the right. The death penalty - abortion conundrum is probably the most confusing to me. The right is primarily against abortion rights and pro death penalty while the left takes the opposite stance. I could never understand how someone who would protect the life of a mass murderer would not fight equally as hard (if not harder) to protect the life of an unborn child. Meanwhile the right argues that life is sacred in arguing against abortion, but fights to kill as many criminals as society will allow. I am against both. However, I am for punishing criminals more stringently bringing back hard menial labor for the worst offenders. </p>

<p>As for Brianís idea to leave the decision up to the victimís family, that would be as useful as asking a lottery winner if he should have to pay taxes on his winnings. Criminals better hope they pick the right family to slice up and kill; maybe they can do a little research on the moral values of their next victimís mother and father. </p>

<p>And since you brought it up, since all of the ì(liberals) superior intelligence and <br />
educationî didnít help their ability to read the Patriot Act the first time they had to vote on it and have subsequently discovered everything wrong with (not to mention the corporate tax loopholes Kerry knew about that he would close once elected), when are the bills going to be introduced to eliminate the act (and the loopholes). It is not your ëI am smarter than youí approach that is losing you elections; it is your inability to defend your arguments on the merits (mainly because they are indefensible).</p>

            <p>Contrary to Brian, my view on the death penalty is a belief, not a position. (ha ha). </p>

<p>Dom, I see what you're saying about the left and right's position on this, but there's one factor I believe makes the left less hypocritical - that is that abortion isn't necessarily killing a human being (obviously 3rd trimester abortions are a different story). Yes we could argue this point. But a similar argument could be made about using condoms. </p>

<p>The right, however, holds a ferverent belief that life begins at the dinner before, but life can only be terminated by the state. If the Christian right is truly both, wouldn't they be fighting as strongly for the abolition of the death penalty as for the abolition of abortion?</p>

<p>And Brian - before you slip too far to the right, I don't think I'm necessarily arguing a "Do what I say" policy, I'm merely showing that the death penalty has not reduced crime it has exacerbated it, and for that reason alone it should be abolished. But I'm not afraid to also note that most of the world has abolished it as well, leaving us in league with some of the most atrocious abusers of human rights. I don't think that's elitest. </p>

<p>What are you saying is something I "have yet to admit" ? That the families will want the killer dead? Obviously! But we have a court of law that decides punishment, not the families.</p>

            <p>I'll tell you why my argument doesn't extend as far back as you seem to think it does. Conception is the only 'but for' in the birth of a child. It is the one thing that has to happen. Even in a petri dish, once the egg is fertilized, it begins a process of rapid expansion and doubles in size every few days. If you put the so called "bunch of cells" in a womb (almost any womb) it has a good chance to develop and be born. That to me is life. You may not want to call it a human being, but I do, because with out that stage in our lives, we would not have been born. I don't see how anyone can believe that we magically become human 6 months after conception. </p>

<p>As for which we should fight harder for, I think we should give the defenseless a voice. The rate death by death penalty is far lower than the rate of abortions.</p>

            <p>I fail to see why we should leave it to those who have lost a loved one to decide whether the death penalty is appropriate or not.  It makes no sense to allow those in a completely unstable frame of mind to dictate public and moral policy.</p>

<p>If someone murdered one of my family members, would I want them dead?  Absolutely.  I'd want them killed in the most painful way possible.  I'd be inconsolable, and I'd rail against those dispassionate observers telling me that the death penalty is wrong.  But I would still expect, just as I do now, the government, the people, to restrain me at that time.  At that very moment when my own ethical beliefs have been compromised, thrown out the window, I want the democratic mechanism of the U.S. government to step in and be the better person.  This is an underlying principle of democracy, and particularly of American federalism: the power flows from the people to the branches of government, and then back around.  By entrusting our powers of citizenship into a larger entity, we transcend ourselves as mere individuals, and create something better, something that is (ideally) more pure, more perfect.</p>

<p>As a society, we have the responsibility to bring justice to those who commit wrongs.  But while putting a criminal to death may indeed be his just deserts, it is a form of justice that is caustic, and double-edged: the criminal entity has been removed from our society for good, but we, as executioners, have corrupted ourselves in so doing.</p>

<p>Compassion for victims is one thing, but compromising our very moral fabric to console them is not justice.</p>

            <p>By the way Nick, the reason you're having trouble removing the image borders from the Typekey author images in your comments is because, as you'll have noticed, MT doesn't actually include the image HTML for the .gif file (nav-commenters.gif - it's in your root site directory by default, i.e., "aesthe.nu/nav-commenters.gif").</p>

<p>The image style is controlled by this code:</p>

<p>.commenter-profile img {<br />
	vertical-align: middle;<br />
	border-width: 0;<br />
	}</p>

<p>which is in the MT stylesheet "styles-site.css".  Just cut and paste it into your master stylesheet and that'll fix the problem.</p>

            <p>Off subject but a few weeks back I made this comment about Ted Rall: "Note: Ted Rall is a lunatic. You can not honestly agree with anything he says." I must apologize since today he has published an article that nearly mirrors my stance on illegal immigration. I take exception to granting them drivers licenses and he doesn't say what he would do with the illegals that have already made it over the border.</p>
