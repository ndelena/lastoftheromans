            <p><i>BOSTON, Massachusetts (AP) -- Hoping to bring capital punishment to Massachusetts, Gov. Mitt Romney is preparing to file a death penalty bill early next year that he says is so carefully written it will guarantee only the guilty are executed.</i></p>

<p><i>Based in part on the findings of a death penalty panel he appointed, the bill would limit capital punishment to the "worst of the worst" crimes including terrorism, the murder of police officers, murder involving torture and the killing of witnesses. It also would use evidence such as DNA testing to protect the innocent.</i></p>

<p><i>Romney wants his death penalty bill to be a model for other states.</i></p>

<p>On October 1, 1997 Jeffrey Curley, an 11 year old boy, was kidnapped from his Cambridge neighborhood, several blocks from MIT. After refusing to take part in sexual intercourse with his kidnappers, he was suffocated. His body was molested and then immersed in a lime and cement-filled container and thrown into the Great Works River in South Berwick, Maine. </p>

<p>This horrific crime, unprecedented in Massachusetts history, ignited a firestorm among concerned parents and citizens. Then-Governor Paul Cellucci, a Republican, stoked the flames in the State Legislature as a capital punishment reinstatement measure came to vote. </p>

<p>Cellucci was confident that the measure would pass, but on the day of the vote, Representative John P. Slattery, a 39-year-old 2nd-term Democrat from Peabody, informed his colleagues that he had rethought his support of the measure, and intended to vote no, in line with his conscience. This came only a week after he joined the razor thin House majority in favor of the measure. </p>

<p>Slatteryís decision condemned the measure to failure in an 80-80 tie vote. The public firestorm soon quieted, but Cellucciís desire to reinstate capital punishment in Massachusetts remained constant. </p>

<p>On March 29, 1999, the measure was again brought before the House. It failed 80-73. </p>

<p>Lt. Gov Jane Swift became Massachusettsí acting governor when Paul Cellucci was appointed Ambassador to Canada by President Bush in early 2001. She continued her predecessorís drive for capital punishment and on March 12, 2001 yet another vote was taken in the Massachusetts House. It was soundly rejected by a vote of 94-60.</p>

<p>The last execution in Massachusetts took place on May 9, 1947. Since then, it has largely become one of the more unreceptive places in the United States for capital punishment. Northeastern University Professor James Alan Fox, a scholar on the death penalty attributes this to the stateís liberal and well-educated populace.</p>

<p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/death-penalty-sign02.jpg" align="left" hspace="4">Current Governor Mitt Romney partly believes he was elected for his campaign promise to reinstate the death penalty. He recently announced the formation of a special panel of experts to determine whether a legal and forensic standard can be established to eliminate the risk of wrongful executions. Under his plan, three categories of homicides will warrant the death penalty: those associated with terrorism, the killing of police officers, prosecutors, judges or trial witnesses, and heinous crimes, such as multiple killings.</p>

<p>Romneyís nascent effort goes against the national tide; in 2000 Illinois Governor George Ryan announced a moratorium on executions after 13 people on death row were found -- through new DNA and other evidence -- to have been wrongly convicted. Since then, death penalty study commissions have been undertaken in Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Federal system, to determine whether justice is truly being done by capital punishment. </p>

<p>There is no arguable need for the death penalty in Massachusetts. The Bay State, with the third highest population density in the U.S., currently has the lowest crime rate of any urbanized state. The greater Boston area, with some three and a half million residents, is the safest metropolitan area in the country. Gov. Romney is under the impression that after the establishment of a costly forensic laboratory, the people of Massachusetts - who are already largely against the death penalty ñ will somehow become capital converts. Not only is this counterintuitive, it approaches insulting. Moreover, evidence ñ from the FBI no less ñ dispels the myth that capital punishment is a crime deterrent. </p>

<p>The three leading states where police officers were feloniously killed in 1998 were California, the state with the highest death row population; Texas, the state with the most executions since 1976; and Florida, the state that is third highest in executions and in death row population. (<i>FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, 1998</i>)</p>

<p>Among the southern states, which comprise 85% of executions in America, we find the top 3 murder rates in the nation (held by Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, respectively). </p>

<p>Currently, the following states do not have death penalty statutes: Alaska, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>A respectable majority of 112 nations have abolished the death penalty. Among Americaís European allies, all have abandoned capital punishment. Even countries such as Angola, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkmenistan have struck down state executions. This places the United States in league w<br />
ith countries such as China, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Vietnam. In fact, in 2002, 81% of known executions took place in China, Iran and the United States.</p>

<p>America can claim no moral high ground in this matter.</p>

<p>Even the father of young Jeffrey Curley, Robert Curley, once an ardent supporter of Cellucciís reinstatement goals, has now changed his mind on the death penalty. In 2001, Curley addressed a conference organized by Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation (MVFR): ìI learned more about the death penalty, some of the problems with it, and I changed my mind.î</p>

<p>If this man, so burdened with the grief of the past, can desire to support more responsible and humane means of justice, surely that should serve as a notice not only to Governor Romney, but to the powers that be in Washington: there will be no death penalty in Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>Following <a href="http://www.bostonconfidential.org" target="_new">Jim's</a> lead, I've installed TypeKey, a comment authorization service. I've been thinking about installing it for a long time to keep spam comments away, but the final straw was today, when I had to delete over 350 spam comments. For those of you unfamiliar with the movabletype blogging engine, it's not exactly fast. So that said, you've just got to register once (and you can use that same identity across all sites using TypeKey). Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>In other geeky concerns, does anyone out there use iTunes to rip cds? I rip them on my laptop then copy them to my desktop pc, where I keep my music. iTunes, generally, is good for ripping and it fills in the ID3 tags nicely, except for the comments section. It inserts several blocks of what looks like code. I tried googling the issue, to see if anyone has written about it, but I came up with nothing. My concern is if the code contains information about <b><i>ME</i></b>. Any ideas? </p>

            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/real-us.gif" hspace="4" align="left">This has been sitting in an Excel file on my computer since the election and I've finally had the time to make a post about it. </p>

<p>Further articulating the widening gulf between "blue" and "red" states, I've compiled a very topical list of socioeconomic data on all states that voted Kerry and states that voted Bush. Having them separated, I used population, median income, poverty rate and percentage of residents with a Bachelor's degree or higher. For geographic convenience I've only included the contiguous Kerry states of the northeast. </p>

<p>As is certainly no surprise, all of the Bush states are a statistical drag on the Kerry states and ultimately the national averages.</p>

<p>The Kerry states alone have an average income of $46,343 (NJ, CT, MD and MA highest, respectively with $55.1k, $53.9k, $52.8k and $50.5k), a poverty rate of 9.7% (NH, MN, and CT lowest, respectively with 6.5%, MN, CT tied at 7.9%) with 27% holding a Bachelor's degree or higher. Massachusetts leads here with 33.2%, followed closely by Maryland with 31.4%.</p>

<p>The Bush states have an average income of $37,259 (AL, WV, MS, and AR lowest, respectively with $24k, $29k, $31k, and $32k), a poverty rate of 13.4% (MS, LA, NM highest with a staggering 19.9%, 19.6%, 18.4% respectively), with 21.9% of the population holding Bachelor's degrees or higher. West Virginia, Mississippi and Arkansas once again occupy the lowest strata here with 14.8%, 16% and 16.7%. It should be noted that two Bush states, Colorado and Virginia had rates comparable with Kerry states (and similarly were only narrow wins for Bush). </p>

<p>Now instead of conveying this with a condescending tone (even though this once again proves that Massachusetts is doing it right), it very clearly shows that although defeated in the presidential election, and losing seats in congress, the Democrats have considerable opportunity in southern states. If the party once again becomes the champions of the poor and working class, while maintaining its traditional "coalition" of labor, academics and minorities, we can once again easiliy become the dominant party, as we were for the majority of the 20th century, when much progress was made.</p>

<p>In an interview with Ted Rall, Pittsburgh City Paper reporter Bill O'Driscoll asked what was so attractive about the right. Rall replied, "<i>The right has been able since the Reagan revolution to express a certain kind of political dynamism that the left hasnít. The liberals have won so many battles throughout the 20th century, that by the time Reagan came along, he was able to propose ideas that were little more than unraveling those [earlier] ideas, but he was able to repackage them as revolutionary. He wanted to get rid of the progressive tax code -- itís not new, itís old,<br />
 but it looks new. People like Ann Coulter, theyíre packaging themselves as revolutionaries, and itís compelling, because you see liberals on the defensive, constantly trying to defend the old victories of civil rights, and womenís rights, the progressive tax code. And these other guys look like theyíre moving forward.</i>"</p>
