            <p>At midnight tonight, September 13, 2004, the 1994 Brady Bill banning assault weapons will expire. In just seven hours from the time of this post, AK-47s, UZIs, TEC-9s, flash suppressors and bayonetted rifles will all be perfectly legal from Maine to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>President Bush, who claims he supports an extension of the ban, has not urged Congress to extend it, instead coming out in criticism of John Kerry, who recently advocated for the ban's extension.</p>

<p>Here are some images of the weapons that will soon be legal:</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g5aug.jpg" alt="Steyr AUG" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steyr AUG</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g6striker.jpg" alt="Striker 12" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Striker 12</p>

<p>The last one is a particularly lethal shotgun known as the Striker 12; the round barrel underneath is a revolving chamber, making the gun automatic firing. Yes, an automatic shotgun.</p>

<p>In gathering research about the bill, I found a site called <a href="http://www.awbansunset.com">AWbansunset</a>. Their motto is "Fighting for the expiration of the '94 "Assault Weapons" Ban!" </p>

<p>They have a link titled "Why Would Anyone Want to Own [an assault weapon]?" in which they say: "There are many answers to that question. It√≠s kind of like asking a car enthusiast why they would ever want to own a 425 horsepower 1968 Corvette Stingray. There are many reasons, some objective, some emotional. All of them legitimate, at least to the driver."</p>

<p>I realize that both a 1968 Corvette and an AK-105 automatic machine gun can easily kill a crowd of people, but at least the former was designed for an alternate purpose.</p>

<p>They continue to say that military rifles are "easy to operate", "reliable", "fun to shoot" and "very accurate." The lynchpin of their argument is in "personal defense" matters. I could not paraphrase it more to fit my argument, so I will quote it directly:</p>

<p><i>With the right type of ammunition, military style rifles can be a very effective defensive weapon. Many police agencies have recognized their value and have adopted their use in close quarter tactical operations. In these post 9/11 days, prudent Americans recognize that we are all vulnerable and should be prepared to defend ourselves, our families, our communities, and our country from threats that can strike us anytime and anyplace. A well-trained person, armed with a military style rifle can provide a deterrent and, if necessary, an effective defense. Full capacity magazines, whether for rifles or pistols, are also very important in this role, particularly in a situation where a homeowner finds him/herself facing multiple attackers.</i></p>

<p>Are people really that paranoid? Regardless, their argument that police forces have adopted these types of weapons does not hold water. In 1997, police in a North Hollywood, CA, shootout with <b>two</b> men had to pull back, because the men were armed with assault weapons. After the event, Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police said: "<i>An AK-47 fires a military round. In a conventional home with dry-wall walls, I wouldn't be surprised if it went through six of them...Police are armed with weapons that are effective with criminals in line of sight. They don't want and don't need weapons that would harm innocent bystanders.</i>" It's that simple.</p>

<p>Also, one of the most notorious uses of assault weapons was the 1993 Branch-Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas. According to a federal affadavit, Davidians had amassed 123 AR-15s, 44 AK-47s, 2 Barrett .50 calibers, 2 Street Sweepers, an unknown number of MAC-10 and MAC-11s, 20 100-round drum magazines, and 260 large-capacity banana clips. "The weapons were bought legally from gun dealers and at gun shows." 74 men, women and children died.</p>

<p>I don't understand why this is even an issue. The 1994 ban should have been made permanent, without a sunset clause. No hunter needs an assault weapon to kill an animal. (Arguably, no hunter needs to hunt either. I hear sup<br />
ermarkets are well stocked these days.)</p>

<p>This is a shame.</p>

            <p>It was 76  men, women, and children that died at Mt. Carmel when the FBI, led by the inept Janet Reno, ordered a tank to drive into the building with boom affixed to flood the building with a mixture of tear gas. The Davidians were not shooting at that point but were following the terms of the cease fire. </p>

<p>The leader, David Koresh, had invited the ATF to search his compound on many occasions before the initial fighting began in February 2003. Heavily armed ATF agents approached his compound. He answered the door and was shot. ATF then began an assault on the compound using helicopters as well as ground fire form agents. It was only during this illegal raid on the facility using excessive force that the Davidians shot back at the ATF. All surviving members of the sect were acquitted of murder charges because they were fully within their right to fight back against the excessive force. After this embarrassment, the FBI took over the operations with regards to Mt. Carmel. Someone has said this was like being hit by kid and having his big brother come in to investigate. Finally, in April, the FBI began to ram the building injecting the Tear Gas into the sides of the building. Ironically, as the tanks were ramming the sides of the building, they were explaining over loud speakers that this was not an assault. The gas eventually helped to fuel a fire most likely caused by the tank, but it is suspected a second fire was started by tear gas shells fired into the back of the building. Assault weapons had nothing to do with those 76 people dying, mostly women and children (only 19 were men). What killed them was an agency fighting for a budget increase.</p>

            <p>Ahhh...a comment from my favorite neo-con...The issue isnt the incompetence of Janet Reno or our federal government, the issue is the use of assualt weapons...seriously, what the hell are you going to do with an assault rifle or automatic shotgun??!!??...You have to love the 9/11 mention in defending ourselves...As for the matter of David Koresh, nobody is defending the actions of the government in that situation...there were a lot of mistakes made, but the fact remains that Koresh and the Branch Davidians were a group that had to be dealt with...they were not peaceful...they were a quasi-religious/militant group...If there are two things that shouldnt mixed its religious fanactics and assault rifles, especially in these post 9/11 days</p>

            <p>That is certainly one interpretation that assault weapons had nothing to do with the deaths. I'm more inclined to believe it was the result of an apocalypse-bent suicidal cult set on brainwashing vulnerable adults and children into idol worship that escalated the conflict to violence.</p>

<p>Regardless of the intricacies of the tragedy, my point remains sound; America does not need assault weapons on its streets. If George Bush is truly our lord savior and protector against terror, shouldn't he make it harder for a small group of people to massacre a shopping mall or busy downtown area? As of today it has been made much easier. Although the Federal Gu<br />
n Control Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 922 prohibits gun ownership under a severalty of conditions, look up the names Greg Pavlidies, Ricky Byrdsong, Officers Ken McGuire and David Lemongello, and Tenille Jefferson if you think the Gun Control Act is foolproof.</p>

<p>What is the justification for the need to own assault weapons?</p>

            <p>Personally, I'm no gun guy. I don't want want, I don't need one. But where does it stop. The assault weapon ban did not curtail violance. If I were to commit a crime, (1) I would certainly not use a legally obtained gun and (2) it would certainly not be an assault rifle. </p>

<p>You seem to be a big fan of European Strategy in terms or weapons/defenses/military strength. Take a look at the Swiss model. Every male citizen at 21 is automatically enlisted, given an AK-47 (or something like it), and some training. They have an Assault rifle in nearly every home in the country. Haven't looked up the stats, but I am willing to bet they have a lower crime/burgulary rate than us.</p>

            <p>I don't know that you can say the ban didn't curtail violence, the late 1990s were one of the least violent periods in American history. </p>

<p>Yes, the Swiss have a far lower crime rate (almost zero) than we do. But they are are also more wealthy (by percentages)  and more educated. And their society has a long tradition of peaceful neutrality, rather than a rally-round-the-flag kill 'em all budweiser broken truck shotgun mentality. </p>

<p>I'm more a fan of the European model of society (everything except their paralysis on lowering rampant unemployment) than their military (I'm not a fan of mandatory conscription).</p>

            <p>They have only been able to maintain that neutrality because of an very strong military defense. That defense strategy is a a lot easier to maintain when you are a small country propped up in the mountains. This strategy is unavailable to the US. And, in my opinion, somewhat immoral, especially when you consider they watched as Nazi Germany invaded the rest of Europe. The only kept Hitler out by inviting him in to see a demonstration of the nearly immediate responce of their citizens to the sound of bell.  They have massive underground bunkers, and invasion would have been nearly impossible with the technology of the era, if not impossible, it would have cost the Germans too much for so little ground.</p>

<p><br />
As for European society, it is just that that is causing the unemployeement. Government jobs can only sustain a society for soolong before the circular funding runs out. Government paying the citizens who in turn pay taxes which then go to pay citizens just doesn't work. Our founders understood this, and there are many writings fearing a Government that consumes more than a 5% GDP. One report says government spending accounts for 43% of out GDP. It can not be sustained, and the only way to limit the exposure to this cyclical, recession every 8 years situation we are in,is to cut government spending, and stop the push for free trade (I think you may agree with me here, or I may be agreeing with you) which does not work because of a built in regulation cost of the goods made in the US and other Industrial nations.</p>

            <p>I don't entirely disagree. The Germans have grown accustomed to massive state unemployment benefits and pension payouts- even when it is bankrupting the state. I'm not for massive omnipresent Government by any means. I'm not for state ownership of industry either (governments are barely efficient enough to manage themselves). What I am for is a capitalism with checks and balances and public oversight. The corporate excesses of the past few years would not have happened if the proper regulations were in place. </p>

<p>I'm also for the cutting of government spending in certain areas. Though I am sure we would disagree on where to cut. (I think Faith-based initiatives would be my first target). I am for efficiencies in govenrment. (I'm a corporate finance minor after all... it balances my ticket). </p>

<p>I'm also against "free trade" - which only seems to benefit CEOs. It certainly doesn't help American manufacturers, or third world laborers who comprise the largest percentage of interested parties.</p>

            <p>I just wanna chime in here quickly on the hunting aspect of owning a gun.  There is sport out there, fishing and hunting being not for food consumption but sport in itself.  I'm a fisher, i never eat the fish i catch I tend to just throw them back or give them to my parents who in turn would eat them.  I've always been for hunting rifles, but never handguns.  A person can do their hunting and have their "protection" with a hunting rifle as well as their sport shooting or target shooting or what not.  I can understand the need or want to have a gun in these situations. You won't see too many crooks robbing banks with rifles, they are too big and attract too much attention.  The majority of canadians that own guns, own hunting rifles, not hand guns.  The gun violence in that country is a mere fraction of what ours is.</p>

<p>Hand guns are  of course used by security personnel, reason being they are quick to use and easy to shoot, so when a police officer has to make a life or death decision to actually shoot their gun (which is rare that they even do) they can  react faster.  A person who owns a handgun isn't going to go hunting with that gun, and when they shoot targets with a hand gun, they are shooting at a an image of a person's body at target galleries across the nation.   A person owning a handgun is going to use it for one reason, and that's to shoot someone.</p>

<p>So I agree, we as citizens of this "free world" should be able to bear arms for sport and the hunt, 2 things that have been around for millenia.   However, the types of arms we should be able to bear should be regulated much tighter. Handguns and especially semiautomatic pistols and most definitly assault rifles should be banned immediately.  Why in the world would you ever need to protect your house using an assault rifle, most likely if you can shoot an entire magazine in under 5 seconds, you are bound to hit atleast one of your family members, nearby neighbors and standerby's.  </p>

<p>The automatic shotgun speaks for itself, that's just plain rediculous.</p>
