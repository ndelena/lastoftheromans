            <p>In a new global poll done by <a href="http://www.globescan.com" target="_new">Globescan (click for more info)</a>, a 5-to-1 majority of polled citizens across 35 countries would like to see John Kerry elected US President over George Bush.  In this massive poll, 34,330 people were asked both who they would like to see elected and also how the Bush Presidency has affected their views of U.S. foreign policy. Out of the 35 nations, only 3 had a margin favoring Bush. A great plurality said they viewed U.S. foreign policy more negatively after four years of Bush.</p>

<p>Selected countries: (% for Kerry, %for Bush)<br />
<blockquote><br />
Norway: 74%-7%<br />
Germany: 74%-10%<br />
France: 64%-5%<br />
Italy: 58%-14%<br />
Spain: 45%-7%<br />
UK: 47%-16%<br />
Canada: 61%-16%<br />
Mexico: 38%-18%<br />
Brazil: 57%-14%<br />
China: 52%-12%<br />
Japan: 43%-32%<br />
Indonesia: 57%-34%<br />
India: 34%-33%</blockquote></p>

<p>The five countries where Bush topped Kerry were: Philippines, Nigeria and Poland (India and Thailand were split-even).</p>

            <p>"Who cares?"  Apparently, the great majority of the world cares.</p>

<p>I don't know how you think you can govern a planet-spanning superpower when most of the world hates you and what you do. That's the great irony of the neo con movement, they think they have this great vision to reshape the world - but - surprise, the rest of the world wants no part of it. It's easy to say "Who cares?"; it's what Bush did when every reasonable voice told him that Iraq would turn into a mess after the Hussein regime collapsed. Oh, they'll flock to 'democracy.'</p>

            <p>Kerry would not change one thing about Iraq. He has said, but then again he has said a lot of things.  The world does not hate what Bush did, they would prefer a President of the US that would pander to their leaders' every wish. Bush leads looking at the needs of the US first. Kerry would allow Ghana to determine our faith.</p>

            <p>The world DOES hate what Bush did, by large swathes. Its effects will be shown as our main allies on the Iraq experiment face elections at home. Already Tony Blair's Labour has lost some of their longest held seats in by-elections to the Liberal Democratsthe only anti-war party in Britain). Most of his own party was against the war, including Clair Short, Blair's former Secretary of International Development who resigned over it. 50% of Britons currently feel the war was unjustified and 72% feel Britain's reputation across the world has suffered as a result.</p>

<p>The Spanish example is even more pertinent. The Socialists (PSOE) long held power after Franco died, ultimately losing to Aznar's Partido Popular (by 1%) in 1996 over allegations of corruption and government backed hit squads on suspected ETA militants. The Spanish electorate was by much larger percentages against the Iraq war, and Aznar's own experiment in European realignment (UK-Italy-Spain) has failed, and Spain is back to its traditional political peers France and Germany.</p>

<p>The Italian election will be the next barometer of the Iraq fallout. Once again, a people largely against the war, by some 75%. With many Italians increasingly frustrated with Berlusconi's power-grip on the media, his election defeat may now be sealed. </p>

<p>So you can say the world doesn't hate what Bush did. Maybe. But he's certainly giving the keys to Europe to his ideological opponents.</p>

<p>Bush leads by looking to his corporate cronies first, then to the Christian Coalition, then to Texas, and somewhere further down the line to the U.S. </p>

<p>What baffles me about Kerry is that he said given everything we know now about the pre-war intelligence he would still vote for the war. That is my strongest point of disagreement with him. I was staunchly anti-war going back to early 2002 when Bush first publically salivated about it, I protested in the rain when it started and I backed Howard Dean in the primaries, largely because of Kerry's ambiguous Iraq stance. Given all that, however, I still think he would handle it more sensibly than Bush. How can a man who hates "nuance" lead a world of 7 billion people, 192 countries, 2,796 major languages, global poverty and terrorism? It is a fucking nuanced world.</p>

<p>Also, Brian, why do you take a backseat every time there's a debate around? Don't go Zell Miller on me. Just kidding.</p>

            <p>Alright, Alright...I'm riding shotgun with you onthis one Nick...</p>

<p>It's obvious, given the data Nick has provided, that world is, at the least, in disagreement with what Bush is doing.  I personally was in favor of the war, up until it was announced that no WMDs would be found in Iraq.  I know, that sounds typical of most people, but if I had the intelligence that Bush, Tenet or even John Kerry had, I would not have been in favor of the war.  In many ways, I feel as though I was "spun" into believing we needed to go to war to protect ourselves.  Spending the semester during the war in DC was also a reality check.  With the biggest target in the US (The Capitol) looming directly overhead outside the plush office appointed to Congressman Markey, I felt a slight level of personal danger and I firmly believed we needed to protect our country.  It is now clear that all the worrying, all the possible links between al-Qaeda and Iraq, all the duct tape and plastic we bought for our apartment outside of DC was a total waste.  And what have we accomplished after the deaths of 1,000 American troops.  ONE THOUSAND TROOPS.  The President of the United States has the lives of many people, including those of the military in his hands.  They serve for us!  The only reciprocation, aside from the menial wages, is that we respect their sacrifices and that the President only employ their forces when absolutely necessary.  Given the intelligence Bush had, and now with what Colin Powell is saying (that he wouldn't have supported the war looking back with the intelligence they have now), it is obvious that the decision to go to war was wrong and that the intel was not a "slam dunk" as Tenet claimed in the Oval Office weeks/days before the start of the invasion.  With that said, Kerry was in a no-win position, in regards to the war.  As a US Senator his strength is thinking, not acting. He decided to vote for the war, but against funding it and said if given the chance to vote again for or against the war, he would vote for it.   He had to say he would still vote for the war because he cannot be seen as weak and "flip-flopping" because the GOP would have jumped all over that.    On the other hand, a lot of people, especially the Democratic base, are against the war.  There lies the predicament.  Simply put, Kerry analyzes too much.  That has been his biggest problem thus far and unless he can turn it around in the coming weeks, we might be in the beginning stages  of the downfall our civilization.  The growing dissention between the world and the US is a major problem, and electing Bush for four more is not going to help.  We are in dire need of change.</p>

            <p>You didn't know Brian is secretly a conservative, he just knows he can't be a hack by making that public.  </p>

<p>My prediction on Iraq Insurgent activity:  The current insurgencies will continue to escalate during the US election cycle. They will hit summit sometime around November 2nd. Post election there will be one of two outcomes. If Kerry wins, the insurgency will continue, it will ease slightly as they regroup and begin to use what Kerry has said over the past few months against the US as they did in Vietnam (coincidentally it will be the same person causing this mental blow to the US public). If Bush wins, the Insurgency will flair slightly heading into late November.  They will be waiting for Bush to sway in strategy. When they determine he will not get weak in the knees, but stand strong, the insurgents will find fewer and fewer volunteers, will have to use stronger means to terrorize the Iraqi people, which will eventually sacrifice the majority of their supporters.  Whatever insurgency that is left will become a page 3 story by March/April.  </p>

<p>Have you heard Putin's response to the brutality of the terrorists at the school. Pretty much mirrors that of George Bush following September 11th. Most countries will not respond to terrorists at home as the Spanish did. God help us all if they do. We need to actively find and eliminate all terrorist threats in the world, and it makes no difference in what form that terrorism comes. I used to be of the opinion that the war is Iraq was right in the beginning but as soon as we learned there were no weapons, we should have pulled out. But unlike but overtime I have come to realize the positive in seeing a fully democratic Iraq.  I do wish we would get back to Afghanistan to replace the joke of a government we put in there. But I think we are doing a much better job in Iraq .</p>

<p>My brother once said that there is <br />
a reason we haven't seen the suicide bombers in the US, when they get here, they see how free we really are, and do everything they can to stay.  I know it was a joke, but I think there is some truth there, and I think it will carry over in the Middle East.</p>

            <p>Come on Brian, the pre war info hasn't changed. You weren't spun into anything. The intel was wrong, and there were no weapons. If you were spun, so wasn't the rest of the world. Nick was against the war on pre-war evidence, we were for it, so did Bush only spin the innfo we saw?  Saddam did nothing to help his case when he prevented the inspectors from doing their job completely.  Knowing what we know today is an ridiculous place to judge anyone, even Kerry. It is what you think we should do now. We know what Bush thinks, we have no idea what Kerry thinks (Though he does know a lot of world leaders).  Change for the sake of change is also stupid. You have a base that hates its candidate. Though I disagree with Bush ona lot of things, namely his insane spending, he is right on this war where it stands today, I know where he will stand tomorrow ,  and that is what matters most.</p>

            <p>Dont try and lump me with the your conservative cabal...I honestly felt, at the time, that the war was necessary because of the trumped up allegations of WMD and the  link between Iraq and al-Qaeda...since then, especially after reading Plan of Attack, and reading more about our intel prior to invading Iraq, I have changed my position.  As for what we need to do now.  If the "Mission" was truly "Accomplished" then we should be able to let Iraq govern itself.  The problem, of course, is that would lead to a lot more problems.  So, from this point forward, the best plan would be to first elect a new leader.  Since our crediblity worldwide has been tarnished by Bush, the only way to get out of the quagmire in Iraq is to start fresh.  After electing Kerry, he would hopefully turn to the UN and lead a coalition...a real one, not just "of the willing"...to help out in Iraq.  Also, a key part of the MidEast situation is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  As the conflict goes, so goes the rest of the MidEast, including Iraq.</p>

            <p>I like the use of every catch phrase from this election season. Did you also consult Against All Enemies in making your decision. Oh, I also enjoy how any coalition excluding France, Germany, or Russia is brushed aside as having no support from the world community. I don't deny the troops/support supplied by other nations in this war was minimal compared to that provided by the US, but what do you think you would get from any of the mother nations.  Can John Kerry tell himself how he plans on getting the support that Bush "failed to seek." That's right, he has those secret meetings with world leaders that privatly tell him they support him, but publicly are unavailable. By the way,  don't forget to check out Lies and the Lying Lyers Who Tell Them.</p>

            <p>Jees guys, I go to class and you continue the debate without me?</p>

<p>Instead of addressing everything that was discussed, which out of reasons of fatigue and wearyness I will avoid, I'd just like to agree with Brian that the Israeli-Palestinian issue is indeed the potential catalyst for change in the Middle East. If we want the respect and cooperation of Arab and Muslim nations, we must be an honest broker in the peace process and check our Israeli bias. Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza have to go, and the corruption and power-grip Yasser Arafat has on the PA have to go as well. If we push equally on both sides, in good faith, our reputation in the Islamic world will benefit. </p>

<p>The key to improving life in Iraq is to improve living conditions. Throwing money earmarked for various infrastructure enhancements toward security is the obvious choice, but I believe it is the wrong one. If ordinary Iraqis can see and feel their lives improving day by day they will begin to trust that their situation is improving. I think this will eventually reduce the amount of friction we encounter... </p>

<p>However a great irony is that we have made the Iraq - al-Qaeda link a self-fulfilling prohpecy; if before there were no al-Qaeda in Iraq, there certainly are now. 150k plus troops are now quite vulnerable... we've given them what they wanted: targets.</p>

            <p>I agree that the our participation in whatever you call the negotiations between Israel and Palestine has to change. I don't think that we should completely drop all bias towards the Israeli's though.  Sharon and Arafat both need to go. I would continue to support the Israeli model of democracy over the Palestinian model of follow the leader. Sure the Israeli democracy is weak at best, but still better than no democracy. Justice on the other hand is difficult to come by when any movement in any direction stirs conflict among the people there. This is a situation no one can nail down one approach to solve. I think splitt<br />
ing the country is not going to work as both groups demand the land is rightfully theirs. But what of the chances that they could live peacefully sharing the land. I think an approach to look at would be creating a joint parliament with representatives from both sides coming together in some formal governing body. Who knows if it will work,  but something has to, or they will certainly destroy themselves. </p>

<p>I agree on your approach in Iraq from here forward. We need to press forward with rebuilding. They need an economy, jobs, and a future in sight. I do not want us to be their primary security force for much longer, and I think we need more Iraqi's trained for this purpose. </p>

<p>Al-qaeda in Iraq is better than al-qaeda in the US. When it comes down to it, I am an American and one American life is worth more than one Iraqi life. You may not agree but, the world isn't perfect. It never will be. There will always be sides and I will always stand on the side America. Our troops are trained to fight these people. Our problem comes from not allowing them to fight. The mosque in Fallujah should have been blown up as soon as we knew what's his face was in there. There is no excuse in my mind for not doing everything we can to stop these people from (1) killing our troops and (2) preventing success in Iraq.</p>

            <p>can you really say a poll that spans 35 countries with only 34,330 responses is accurate or even scientific?   These results average  out to less than a thousand people per country polled.  For example in Brazil, they only polled 500 people in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro "face to face".   These are not accurate sample sizes for a scientific statistical study.  Equally funny in this "study" is the 522 people surveyed in Spain.  How can you represent a country with these population sample sizes?</p>

            <p>If I thought the poll was inaccurate I wouldn't have posted it. In the Spanish example, an estimated 3 million people protested in Madrid (1 in 15 Spaniards) at the March 2003 launching of hostilities. In every poll taken (links below) opposition to Iraq among the Spanish populace ranges from 69% to 80%. So while polling 500 Spaniards may not be as statistically relevant on its own, the percentage results are quite along the curve. I did not post the poll because I thought it an abberation.</p>

<p>In a poll out last week by EOS Gallup Europe of 10,000 Americans and  Europeans found 80% believing the Iraq war "was not worth the loss of life and other costs." Up 10% from a 2003 poll. 76% responded as "opposed" to the Iraq war. In this same poll 96% of Greeks say the war was "unjustified.' </p>

            <p>When is Koffi going on trial for the Oil for Food Scandal.  The UN is an archaic institution. It needs a new charter more reflective of the current world environment. Namely, the US is the sole super power, and its involvement in the UN does not mean every other nation in the world will be allowed to gang up on it under the guise of worldwide government and tell us how to run our affairs. Especially when they assign libya to head the Human Rights council. I have an idea, let's giveNorth Korea a permanent seat on the security council.</p>

            <p>Nobody suggests we give N.K. a permanent seat.  The idea of the UN is idealistic, but still, it is an institution we should encourage rather than spit in the face of.  Granted, we are the sole superpower, for now, and we will determine whether the UN goes the way of the League of Nations or if it thrives.  It seems obvious that it has to thrive, especially in our age of globalization.  The idea of a strong globably run governing council is imminent and the UN is our best hope.  </p>

<p>My trouble, however, with the UN is that it is a mountain of red tape, which leads to your point of Libya heading the Human Rights Council.  The UN needs a major administrative overhaul (think effective and efficient).  It also needs to act the part of a powerful council, rather than merely being a ceremonial institution.</p>

            <p>I agree with you Brian. Basically the U.N. follows the European way of governance; relaxed and socialist. In order to effectively operate with the United States you have to speak its language: action over consideration, reaction over progression. Sad but true.</p>

<p>However, there are many many areas in which the U.N. must improve. We all can agree that Libya's appointment to the Human Rights Commission was a complete farce. Perhaps if the U.N. introduced performance-based appointments we would see an improvement in human rights conditions in these nations. Democrats should not fall into the trap of turning their hatred of Bush's unilateralism to blind love of the U.N. Certainly Elanor Roosevelt is turning in her grave.</p>

<p>That said, I still believe the U.N. is a force for good and is an institution that should be supported.</p>

            <p>That is great that they have time to report on 2, that's right 2 whole misstatements by Rumsfeld, but no where on their main news page does it say anything about Dan Rather participating in fraud on a major news program for CBS. Doesn't say anything about his refuseal to admit his was duped, which tells me he wasn't duped but actually participated in this idiotic attempt at rehashing something that can not be proven from 35 years ago,  and issue a correction. Where is the reporting on this major story? </p>

<p>And on misstatements, Ben Shapiro wrote a great article that pointed to the ignored mistakes made by Kerry during this campaign, but then again everything coming out of his mouth is a mistake since he takes the opposite poosition the next time he speaks.</p>

            <p>the whole rather/documents "scandal" is ridiculous...if you investigated the issue a bit futher, unlike the majority of right leaning news outlets (drudge/foxnews),  you would notice that it is only the paper and print that are in question...what the documents state is all fact and to prove that, the 80-something secretary who wrote up the documents publicly states she remembers writing those documents...the fact is that bush cowered his way to a cozy na<br />
tional guard spot while john kerry put his life on the line for our country...also, whos to say the GOP (Karl Rove) didn't orchestrate this "scandal"</p>

            <p>If you have the proof, please bring it forward. The fact is that they don't have the proof. They assume the world will believe the great news man Dan Rather and how can we question Dan's integrity.  Dan Rather is trying to pass the burden of proof onto the defendant here, and the world simply doesn't work that way.  And if you think the Republican are behind this you listen to Jay Severin too much.  Dennis Miller said it last night when someone on his panel gave the very common O'reilly line, "Rather isn't putting these documents out there himself." Miller responded, "you don't think that is possible, I don't put it past him."</p>

<p>Notice the proof against Bush is proven false. The charges and evidence against Kerry's war record are simply brushed off as "questioning his patriotism." </p>

<p>Why are these obviously phony documents (even CBS' experts said don't use them in the report) passed across the screen in a blaze of glory, but the story some 200 Vietnam vets is ignored as partisan politics because the 200 people who ate, slept, and socialized with John Kerry were usually about 20 yards away from him when captaining his boat, clearly too far away to have not seen the fire that the Kerry boat saw.</p>

<p>Mutual agreement, lets put up a fence, I don't know maybe 20 years, anything older than 20 years can't be brought up in an election season.  Don't worry, that's long enough that we can't bring up that Ted Kennedy's car has killed more people than my AK-47.</p>

            <p>About 64,000 people a year seek professional medical assistance because of gun accidents. I think we can say Ted Kennedy is on the near rather than far side of the number of people killed in TK related incidents. Certainly that is an off-center topic. TK is my man. </p>

<p>Look, it sucks that you're a conservative in a liberal state, it's like being the bastard son. Why stay at home? Mom doesn't want you there. Dads gone. Liberalism gone awry they like to think. Well actually Mass is rocking the house. It's very much 2:33 am and I'm too tired to back this up with anything more than 'fightin words' but we are far from Taxachusetts and a creativity-stifling hotbed of taxation. I will prove this in my next post.</p>
