            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/roy_davis.jpg" alt="Roy Davis" align="left" hspace="4">In yet another example of the injustices inherent in our corporate interests-dominated healthcare industry, the BBC News' latest Photo journal titled "America's uninsured" features a story about Defannie Davis, whose husband Roy suffered a massive stroke in 2002, as a result of not being able to afford his blood pressure medication. After his stroke, his kidneys failed, he contracted pneumonia and he was in a coma for three days. He's now unable to speak at all and is undergoing various forms of therapy. After his initial stroke he suffered another one, and a heart attack. Only after incurring immense medical expenses did Medicaid kick in. We are not told what the Davis family owes in outstanding medical costs... we're only told that one bill alone was over $26,000. Under Medicaid, the Davis family only pays $1 for their medication. Roy Davis must undergo dialysis three time a week and has developed numerous infections as a result of the dialysis procedure. </p>

<p>It is a journal that seems to touch upon the overwhelming inhumanity and irony of 45 million Americans going uninsured - in the "wealthiest" nation on earth. Our current system demands the poor be poorer before it will offer assistance. In both my stays in the U.K. and Spain all health care and medication was freely available (even to me). To the European viewers of the photo journal, the Davis' story must seem barbaric. And it is.</p>

            <p>In a new global poll done by <a href="http://www.globescan.com" target="_new">Globescan (click for more info)</a>, a 5-to-1 majority of polled citizens across 35 countries would like to see John Kerry elected US President over George Bush.  In this massive poll, 34,330 people were asked both who they would like to see elected and also how the Bush Presidency has affected their views of U.S. foreign policy. Out of the 35 nations, only 3 had a margin favoring Bush. A great plurality said they viewed U.S. foreign policy more negatively after four years of Bush.</p>

<p>Selected countries: (% for Kerry, %for Bush)<br />
<blockquote><br />
Norway: 74%-7%<br />
Germany: 74%-10%<br />
France: 64%-5%<br />
Italy: 58%-14%<br />
Spain: 45%-7%<br />
UK: 47%-16%<br />
Canada: 61%-16%<br />
Mexico: 38%-18%<br />
Brazil: 57%-14%<br />
China: 52%-12%<br />
Japan: 43%-32%<br />
Indonesia: 57%-34%<br />
India: 34%-33%</blockquote></p>

<p>The five countries where Bush topped Kerry were: Philippines, Nigeria and Poland (India and Thailand were split-even).</p>

            <p>At midnight tonight, September 13, 2004, the 1994 Brady Bill banning assault weapons will expire. In just seven hours from the time of this post, AK-47s, UZIs, TEC-9s, flash suppressors and bayonetted rifles will all be perfectly legal from Maine to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>President Bush, who claims he supports an extension of the ban, has not urged Congress to extend it, instead coming out in criticism of John Kerry, who recently advocated for the ban's extension.</p>

<p>Here are some images of the weapons that will soon be legal:</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g4ar15.jpg" alt="AR-15" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AR-15</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g5aug.jpg" alt="Steyr AUG" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steyr AUG</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/g6striker.jpg" alt="Striker 12" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Striker 12</p>

<p>The last one is a particularly lethal shotgun known as the Striker 12; the round barrel underneath is a revolving chamber, making the gun automatic firing. Yes, an automatic shotgun.</p>

<p>In gathering research about the bill, I found a site called <a href="http://www.awbansunset.com">AWbansunset</a>. Their motto is "Fighting for the expiration of the '94 "Assault Weapons" Ban!" </p>

<p>They have a link titled "Why Would Anyone Want to Own [an assault weapon]?" in which they say: "There are many answers to that question. Itís kind of like asking a car enthusiast why they would ever want to own a 425 horsepower 1968 Corvette Stingray. There are many reasons, some objective, some emotional. All of them legitimate, at least to the driver."</p>

<p>I realize that both a 1968 Corvette and an AK-105 automatic machine gun can easily kill a crowd of people, but at least the former was designed for an alternate purpose.</p>

<p>They continue to say that military rifles are "easy to operate", "reliable", "fun to shoot" and "very accurate." The lynchpin of their argument is in "personal defense" matters. I could not paraphrase it more to fit my argument, so I will quote it directly:</p>

<p><i>With the right type of ammunition, military style rifles can be a very effective defensive weapon. Many police agencies have recognized their value and have adopted their use in close quarter tactical operations. In these post 9/11 days, prudent Americans recognize that we are all vulnerable and should be prepared to defend ourselves, our families, our communities, and our country from threats that can strike us anytime and anyplace. A well-trained person, armed with a military style rifle can provide a deterrent and, if necessary, an effective defense. Full capacity magazines, whether for rifles or pistols, are also very important in this role, particularly in a situation where a homeowner finds him/herself facing multiple attackers.</i></p>

<p>Are people really that paranoid? Regardless, their argument that police forces have adopted these types of weapons does not hold water. In 1997, police in a North Hollywood, CA, shootout with <b>two</b> men had to pull back, because the men were armed with assault weapons. After the event, Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police said: "<i>An AK-47 fires a military round. In a conventional home with dry-wall walls, I wouldn't be surprised if it went through six of them...Police are armed with weapons that are effective with criminals in line of sight. They don't want and don't need weapons that would harm innocent bystanders.</i>" It's that simple.</p>

<p>Also, one of the most notorious uses of assault weapons was the 1993 Branch-Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas. According to a federal affadavit, Davidians had amassed 123 AR-15s, 44 AK-47s, 2 Barrett .50 calibers, 2 Street Sweepers, an unknown number of MAC-10 and MAC-11s, 20 100-round drum magazines, and 260 large-capacity banana clips. "The weapons were bought legally from gun dealers and at gun shows." 74 men, women and children died.</p>

<p>I don't understand why this is even an issue. The 1994 ban should have been made permanent, without a sunset clause. No hunter needs an assault weapon to kill an animal. (Arguably, no hunter needs to hunt either. I hear sup<br />
ermarkets are well stocked these days.)</p>

<p>This is a shame.</p>

            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/images/letter-t.gif" align="left" hspace="1">hree years ago, I sat on the subway at Wonderland station, waiting for the train to leave. It was my junior year of college and I was late for a marketing class. It was early but warm and I was groggy and disgruntled as usual. Typically the train waits for no more than five minutes, but this particular morning I sat for fifteen or twenty minutes. The driver came on and said that downtown service had been suspended. He ran out of the front of the car and into the station chief's office. I caught a glimpse of three people inside huddled around a television before the door shut. </p>

<p>I drove back home to find three messages on my answering machine from Tom. The first one was just to say that something bizarre happened and a plane hit the World Trade Center. I figured it was a small propellered plane horribly off course or in danger. The second message was markedly more frantic, as the second plane hit. I hit stop before the message finished, grabbed my phone and turned the television on. I was on the phone with Tom for a few hours - we were both silent; watching the television in shock. They broke from New York to Washington as Peter Jennings on ABC first reported smoke sighted and I remember my first thought was if Boston would be next.</p>

<p>My house is only about four miles from Logan airport in Boston, and my neighborhood is below the flight path for two or three of the runways. There's always the remote sound or sight of an airplane somewhere. That afternoon, for the first time, I went outside and down to the beach at the end of the street and heard nothing. There was no activity at the airport and the skies were blue and quiet. I sat there for an hour or so, and soon saw two F-15 fighter jets scream along the ocean heading south and turning over Boston. It seemed quite unnatural to see our military on duty- at home. For the next three days the F-15s were the only objects in the sky, steely gray and reflective in the sunlight.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, America had a historic opportunity to take the world's unity to heart and fight a "war on terror" with hundreds of allies and trillions of dollars in resources - and with billions of people behind the cause. This strategy was renounced quickly, with the administration instead opting for a rally-behind-the-dictator style war frenzy. Osama was the objective, then he was not. al-Qaeda was the objective, then it was not. Afghanistan was the battleground, then it was forgotten. Now we're embroiled in an Iraqi occupation with hundreds of thousands of troops and hundreds of billions of tax dollars. And now there's talk of Syria and Iran being next. </p>

<p>Yes, it is three years later. </p>

<p>And what do we see? A slipping, a loss of control, a distortion in the world's balance. Allies renounced, American military bases spanning massive swaths of formerly Soviet territory, cutting into previously unknowable countries such as Kyrgizstan and Tajikistan. </p>

<p>An administration eager to Americanize Iraq, at the cost of 1,000+ American lives (over 7,000 injured), and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives. An administration that chooses an imperial war and turns its back on legitimate humanitarian crises as the one occuring in Darfur. </p>

<p>The USA Patriot Act shoved through congress overnight, allowing government searches without warrants. Detentions without due process. A complete disregard for habeas corpus.</p>

<p>The neo-conservatives have won the civil war in the Republican party. The old fiscal conservatives who were reluctant to send the military anywhere are dead and gone. We now witness the party of the zealous evangelicals bent on simplifying a complex world. They are actively fighting to undermine diversity and harmony at home and hasten an ideological reshaping of the world in their own narrow and distorted image. They spend deeply into deficit, while distributing subsidies to the wealthiest 1%. Their Iraq experiment has gone horribly awry; pushing moderate, reform-minded Arabs into anti-American positions, undermining democratic reforms in Syria, Iran and Egypt, sending a message to the world that the United States is not interested in home-grown democracy, but in "Made in the USA"-branded socio-corporatism on the sharp end of a bayonet.</p>

<p>We've now given our once-No.1 enemy (al-Qaeda, remember them?) a historic opportunity to massacre as many American soldiers as they can in Iraq, as our troops are kept there longer and longer, as retired military personnel are called back, as soldiers are denied leave and not told when they'll return home to their loved ones. (As Donald Rumsfeld realizes American military might is finite.)</p>

<p>We see the politicization of our national tragedy at the Republican National Convention. We see 3,000 people - Americans, Brits, Australians, Indians, Christians, Athiests, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, like you or I who lost their lives simply by going to work made into fear-driven stump speeches. When our heart-attack prone bleeding from the mouth Vice President tells the country ""It's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on Nov. 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States." - vote George Bush or die.</p>

<p>Ours is an America hijacked, careening down a dead-end mountain road of cliff-edges. We need to wrest control of the emergency brake and take back our democracy, not just for ourselves, but for the world.</p>

<p>France's <b>Liberation</b> - editorial: <i>Since 11 September 2001, terrorism has been the basic parameter of international politics... The military and police response is necessary and the networks inspired by Bin Laden have fortunately taken as many blows as they have delivered. But al-Qaeda has not disappeared, and the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq is playing into the hands of the jihadists. The war against Islamo-terrorism... cannot be won by the force of American arms alone, as is proved by each day that passes in Iraq.</i></p>

<p>Germany's <b>Der Tagesspiegel</b> - commentary by Harald Martenstein: <i>The terrorists' driving force was hatred... hatred of freedom. What has happened since then? In the USA the patriot act has restricted civil liberties; a detention centre was built that is a mockery of democr<br />
atic principles, and a war was begun on grounds that before 11 September no one would have accepted... Fear is useful. But it must not make us blind or hysterical. The world has become less free since 11 September 2001; that is unfortunately a victory for the terrorists.</i></p>

<p>Spain's <b>El Pais</b> - editorial headlined "Getting worse": <i>9/11 aroused a wave of sympathy and European solidarity for the United States, which Bush not only did not know how to take advantage of, but scorned. Three years later, precisely because of Iraq, the transatlantic breach has grown in a worrying way.</i></p>

<p>Pakistan's <b>Dawn</b> - editorial: <i>The 9/11 tragedy has all but been pushed into the background by the mayhem that has been let loose in Iraq and the blundering pursuit of an illegal war. The images from Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib have overtaken the shattering images of the Twin Towers... It is time for everyone to pause and take a deep breath and go back to the drawing board. A far greater reliance on political methods and better intelligence gathering seems the only alternative to the present total and counter-productive dependence on brute force.</i></p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's <b>Al-Riyadh</b> - editorial: <i>The trouble with Bush is that he put America's honour above everything and regarded 11 September as a cue for the USA to behave in a way that would guarantee its position as the undisputed superpower, taking decisions regardless of its acceptance or rejection by friends and allies.</i></p>

<p>And lastly a very thoughtful and gentile editorial from Japan's <b>Asahi Shimbun</b>: <i>Two virtues of the American people are the courage to sacrifice oneself and the admiration of self-sacrifice. In the world of international politics, the United States has the strength to endure sacrifice for the benefit of attaining the goal. That is exactly why we want the Americans to know that the use of force requires wisdom. We want the United States to characterise itself as part of a diverse and multi-polar world by overcoming the narrow values of unilateralism. Washington should pay attention to the negative sides of globalisation as well and thus try to eradicate the breeding grounds of terrorism.</i></p>

<p>In the flood of reporting following that warm September day, I heard one commentator say that the United States was "the world's best hope for ordinary days." I believed it then, and even after three years of chaos, war and decline I still believe it.</p>

<p>"<i>When it went off, in the New Mexico dawn, that first atomic bomb, we thought of Alfred Nobel, and his hope, his vain hope, that dynamite would put an end to wars. We thought of the legend of Prometheus, of that deep sense of guilt in man's new powers, that reflects his recognition of evil, and  his long knowledge of it. We knew that it was a new world,  but even more we knew that novelty itself was a very old thing in human life, that all our ways are rooted in it.</i> - J. Robert Oppenheimer</p>

            <p>After a bit of research, I've come up with a humorous little graph that proves Republicans get votes by instilling fear into voters. In one set of statistics taken from <i>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</i>, a book by Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam, participants across all fifty states were asked if they felt "most people can be trusted." I contrasted the percentage responding favorably to the percentage of the el<br />
ectorate who voted for George W. Bush in each state in the 2000 election (taken from fec.gov). The results quantify the fearmongering quite clearly.</p>

<p>The graph was compiled from the following table of statistics:</p>

            <p>True to form, another example of the continued Republican blurring of truth has emerged after the convention. This time it's not about George Bush!</p>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, everybody's favorite Austrian immigrant governor, lied in his convention speech about having witnessed communism firsthand under Soviet occupation, and having left Austria in the 60s as a "Socialist" government.</p>

<blockquote><i>"It's a fact ñ as a child he could not have seen a Soviet tank in Styria," the southeastern province where Schwarzenegger was born and raised, historian Stefan Karner told the Vienna newspaper Kurier.</i>

<p><i>Schwarzenegger, now a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born on July 30, 1947, when Styria and the neighboring province of Carinthia belonged to the British zone. At the time, postwar Austria was occupied by the four wartime allies, which also included the United States, the Soviet Union and France.</i></p>

<p><i>The Soviets already had left Styria in July 1945, less than three months after the end of the war, Karner noted.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>Regarding the Austrian government in power in 1968 (the year Schwarzenegger left):</p>

<blockquote><i>What's more, when Schwarzenegger left in 1968, Austria was run by a conservative government headed by People's Party Chancellor Josef Klaus, a staunch Roman Catholic and a sharp critic of both the Socialists as well as the Communists ruling in countries across the Iron Curtain.</i>

<p><i>Schwarzenegger "confuses a free country with a Socialist one," said Polaschek, referring to East European Communist officials' routine descriptions of their countries as Socialist.</i></blockquote></p>

            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/bush-hands.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="4" alt="George bush describes the Federal budget deficit.">With the end of the week comes the end of the Republican National Convention's "All 9/11, all the time" God-festival at Madison Square Garden. Between bouts of Elizabeth Dole saying "Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion" (how can freedom be conditional?) and Schwarzenegger's "If you have a pulse, you're a Republican" diatribe, we have George duh-byah's convention closer, a perfectly crafted Sept. 11th PR device designed to simultaneously play to the fears of Southern dolts and enrage tri-staters (and New Englanders) who were personally affected by the attacks. </p>

<p>Having watched the speech with a native New Yorker provided a line by line validation of my belief that Bush's continued milking of the 9/11 tragedy is nothing more than a disgraceful election tactic to rouse the NASCAR, 9/11 souveneir buying crowd. In Boston I think we are close enough to the tragedy to see when ethical lines are clearly crossed; when the issue has moved from healing wounds of a national tragedy to garnering single point percentage gains in key battleground states. But in having the convention in Manhattan, the Republicans have shown machiavellian acuity at the cost of sincerity. And it is sickening.  </p>

<p>Bush's speech was merely a collection of reactionary rallying cries crafted to appeal to the inherent desire of all Americans to see their country safe and happy. The true Orwellian genius here is how Bush insists the natural human desire for safety is inexorably linked to the Republican sociopolitical platform. It is further designed to blur the line between the Iraq war and the war on terrorism, to blur the justification of that war from weapons of mass destruction to removing a despot: "Do I forget the lessons of September 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time." Repeated statements by the 9/11 Comission that Iraq and al-Qaida were not cooperating in any way are brushed to the side.</p>

<p>The Kerry campaign needs to point these things out and furthermore it needs to express to the American people that the world is not black and white, right and wrong, good and evil. It is a complicated, highly nuanced world, and we need an intelligent, dare I say brilliant leader who can understand details and intricacies and generate sincere, well thought out strategies based on the aggregation and extrapolation of these data. Anyone with a brain and a computer can easily learn the basic governing philosophies of Hussein's Ba'athist movement and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida. </p>

<p>The Ba'athist party emerged in the 1960s as (ironically) a pan-Arab socialist alternative to despotic right-wing monarchies. It was wholly secular (sometimes Atheist) and followed for some time the principles of Socialism. al-Qaida is rooted in the ultra-orthodox religious backlash to the Arab socialist movement. It seeks full integration of mosque and state and full implementation of Islamic Sharia law. It effectively advocates a return to the style of life of the 7th century A.D. Now bear in mind, Hussein's government hardly represented Socialism as it was intended, but it is clear to see that the two philosophies are squarely incompatible.</p>

<p>Bush's speech was light on the economy and bin Laden, light on future plans other than to say he wishes to see the power of corporations and HMOs protected, and the power of the people to seek a redress of grievances eliminated or suppressed. He made Afghanistan and Iraq seem like the Cirque de Soleil, having failed to mention that kidnapping and murder are rife in Baghdad and the Hamid Karzai government of Afghanistan only controls the capital of Kabul, the remainder of the country is in the hands of warlords, much as it was for the past twenty years.</p>

<p>My prediction of a second Bush term: increasing interest rates, lagging job growth, tax reform to favor multinational conglomorates, tort reform to favor corporations, a further blurring of the separation of church and state, and, dreadfully, perhaps Supreme Court appointments of right-wing reactionaries. A thought that should rightly shake anyone of reason to the bone.</p>

<p>From the Daily Show: "For four years George W. Bush has used the power of words to overcome insurmountable facts."</p>

<p>Admittedly, I was concerned when I heard about Zell Miller speaking at the Republican National Convention. It's always damaging when one of your own (debatable) breaks ranks and goes on national television to tell America why your party doesn't deserve the vote. I was concerned. But after I saw his speech, reminiscent of George Wallace and the hate-filled segregationists of the 1960s, I realized that it would probably do more damage to George Bush's reelection than to Kerry's campaign. Granted, Miller's style is inflamatory and sensationalistic, but this time his age shown and his speechwriter's lack of preparedness also shown; the main themes of his Diatribe Against Democrats (DAD) are wholly without substance. </p>

<p>His main points were: 1) Democrats view American troops as "occupiers" and therefore are treasonous, 2) Kerry does not support the U.S. military as demonstrated by his votes against certain military budgets that would have expanded production orders for the B-1, B-2, F-14, F-15, F-16, M-1 and Apache fighting vehicles, 3) something about nobody being like Wendell Wilkie anymore.</p>

<p>1) Interestingly, it was George Bush who first referred to American troops as occupiers.<br />
<b>April 13, 2004 8pm prime time press conference.</b><br />
"As a proud and independent people, Iraqis do not support an indefinite occupation - and neither does America."<br />
"They're not happy they're occupied. I wouldn't be happy if I were occupied either."</p>

<p><b>May 24, 2004, 8pm, press conference from the US Army War College, Carlisle, PA.</b><br />
"The occupation will end, and Iraqis will govern their own affairs."</p>

<p><b>May 25, 2004, interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation's John Shovelan.</b><br />
"On June 30th, the Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist and will not be replaced. The occupation will end, and Iraqis will govern their own affairs."</p>

<p>I would be willing to bet that Bush has referred to our troops more as occupiers than Democrats have.</p>

<p>2) Kerry in his tenure in the Senate had approved 16 of 19 budgets. The ones he didn't approve, interestingly, Dick Cheney, as Secretary of Defense under George H. W. Bush also did not approve of. He was famous for imposing strict spending controls. Cheney at the time said: "You've squabbled and sometimes bickered and horse-traded and ended up forcing me to spend money on weapons that don't fill a vital need in these times of tight budgets and new requirements." Referring to the M-1, F-14 and F-16 as "great weapons" that we "have enough of."</p>

<p>3) Of Wendell Wilkie, Miller says: "In 1940, Wendell Wilkie was the Republican nominee. And there's no better example of someone repealing their 'private plans' than this good man. He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time. And he made it clear that he would rather lose the election than make national security a partisan campaign issue."</p>

<p>Actually, that's not quite accurate. Wilkie campaigned against Roosevelt's New Deal and advocated increased military spending. Roosevelt preempted that by expanding military contracts during the campaign - so Wilkie switched directions and accused the president of "warmongering." The election was held (Miller makes it sound like Wilkie withdrew) with Roosevelt garnering 449 electoral votes to Wilkie's 42. It was only after this election that Wilkie decided to support Roosevelt, eventually becoming his personal representative to Britain.</p>

<p>Zell Miller's style is light on facts and heavy on fiery southern-fried rhetoric. </p>

<p>I did some additional investigating into Miller's past and found something that sheds some light on his oratorical style (and perhaps his nascent party-shift). In the 1960s, Miller was the Chief of Staff for Lester Maddox, Georgia governor and segregationist. Maddox was so virulently racist that he distributed axe handles to patrons of his family-owned restaurant the night the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed, to keep African Americans from entering his restaurant. That same night he chased protesters away with a pistol. As Governor he openly advocated defiance of the act. And now we're supposed to find Miller a credible critic of the Democratic party. Well frankly, our party is much better without him and his new allegiance to the GOP is just as fitting.</p>

Arnold Schwarzenegger's convention speech last night at Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>"If you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government... then you are a Republican! If you believe a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group... then you are a Republican! If you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does... then you are a Republican! If you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children... then you are a Republican! If you believe this country, not the United Nations, is the best hope of democracy in the world... then you are a Republican! And, ladies and gentlemen... if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism... then you are a Republican!"</p>

<p>Please allow me to dissect this line by line.</p>

<p>1. If you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>I think the passage of the USA Patriot Act rather disproves this, in addition to rather disproving any pretensions the Republicans might have of being the party of non-intrusive government.</i></p>

<p>2. If you believe a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>This is easy: Cheney's Haliburton did $73 million in business with Saddam Hussein during the 1990s, had Arthur Anderson as Haliburton's accounting firm (same on as Enron). Additionally, through the use of subsidiaries and 44 "tax friendly" shelters, Haliburton became a subsidized company, rather than one that had to pay taxes. Interestingly, when Cheney left to become the vice presidential candidate, Haliburton gave him a $34 million retirement package. Now, of course a campaign contribution of that size would surely have been illegal... so it was just a retirement package. Of course. Condoleeza Rice had a goddamn Chevron oil tanker named after her. Andrew Card lobbied on behalf of GM against stricter emissions standards. Spencer Abraham, Secretary of Energy, proposed to get rid of the Energy Department thre times in his stint as a Michigan Representative. He also received donations from Enron. U.S. Trade Rep Robert Zoelick was a paid consultant for Enron. Michael Powell, Chairman of the FCC is Colin Powell's son.  Bush named Michael Powell head of the FCC.  The FCC presided over a case involving AOL.  Colin Powell served on the board of AOL and is a significant holder of AOL stock.  Michael Powell was the only member of the FCC to advocate that the AOL-Time Warner merger go through without investigation. You want to tell me this administration is free of special interest?</i></p>

<p>3. If you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>The most successful attack strategies the Republicans have launched against Democrats have been on taxes. They've painted the specter of Democrats as waiting in the hollows for their moment to strike, raising taxes to 95%, picking pockets of old women and stealing piggie banks. Yet let's think back, was the tax rate of the Clinton administration oppressive? I remember doing quite well back then. In fact, I earned more in 2000 then I did this year, since I got laid off by the Bush economy. Regardless, Arnold's statement isn't entirely false: Your family probably does know how to spend its money better than the Bush government. We have a record budget deficit of $400 billion a year, projected to be closer to $500 billion with the immense and growing cost of supporting the Iraq occupation. Our outstanding total debt grows at $1.72 billion dollars a day, swelling to $7.36 trillion dollars (or $25,000 per capita).</i></p>

<p><i><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/us-debt.gif" alt="1999 chart detailing 10 years of projected budget surpluses" hspace="2" align="left">I know the public memory is short, but lets think back to the end of the Clinton administration. Back to 1999. I quote a BBC article: "Last year, the government had a surplus of $69.2 billion, a total which is likely to be exceeded this year. It is the first time since 1957 that the US has had two consecutive years of budget surplus. Official projections suggest trillions of dollars in budget surpluses over the next 15 years, boosted by a strong economy and strict controls on spending." This was an administration of Democrats. Let's not forget that. And if you also remember the Republicans in power at the time demanded that all budget surpluses be given back as tax cuts, instead of paying down the debt so that our nation isn't foreclosed by the foreign debtors we owe. The graph above shows a "what if" scenario - what if Clinton's economic policy of debt repayment had continued. Well, this year, instead of having $7.36 trillion in debt we'd have $2.8 trillion and shrinking. Do we think these debts can continue to amass?</i></p>

<p>4. If you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>If you believe we should trick Democrats into voting for an educational reform package, then not fund the program, you're a Republican!</i></p>

<p>5. If you believe this country, not the United Nations, is the best hope of democracy in the world... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>Just take a look at our involvement in the following countries: Philippines, 1945-53 (fighting letist Huks even as Huks fought off Japanese); South Korea, 1945-53 (establishment of right-wing dictatorship, not democratic until 1983); Italy, 1947-48 (prevented democratically elected Communists from taking power); Greece, 1947-49 (supported former fascists in civil war); Albania, 1949-53 (failed coup attempt); Iran, 1953 (ousted democratically elected Mossadegh); Guatemala, 1953-1990s; Indonesia, 1957-58; British Guiana/Guyana, 1953-64 (ousted democratically elected Socialist); Vietnam, 1950-73; Brazil, 1961-64 (ousted democratically elected socialist); Dominican Republic, 1963-66 (ousted demo<br />
cratically elected socialist); Indonesia, 1965 (liberal Sukarno ousted, fascist Gen. Suharto put in power); Chile, 1964-73 (assasination of PM-elect Salvador Allende); Greece, 1964-74 (supported monarchists/fmr. facists in civil war); Nicaragua, 1978-89 (funded right-wing paramilitaries against democratically elected sandinistas); Grenada, 1979-84 (ousted socailist government, installed brutal fascist dictatorship); Afghanistan, 1979-92 (Zbignew Brezinski wanted to "give Soviets their own Vietnam" and drew Soviets in, funding mujahadeen forces. After Soviets withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, leaving the country devastated and in the hands of power-hungry warlords) ; El Salvador, 1980-92 (supported an insurgency of right-wing paramilitaries); Haiti, 1987-94; Iraq, 2003-? (tricked congress into giving executive branch imperial-style powers by providing false intelligence, disposed former ally Hussein, installed Iyad Allawi, former Ba'athist into power. Allawi personally shot six Iraqi prisoners in order to "send a clear message to the police on how to deal with insurgents.").</i></p>

<p>6. And, ladies and gentlemen... if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism... then you are a Republican.</p>

<p><i>There's definitely no evidence to say that Democrats don't want to defeat terrorism. In fact, we would probably have a much more level headed approach than the prevailing neo-con "pave the world" policy. A concerted effort to root out poverty and political and economic injustice in the middle east might be a good start.</i></p>
