            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/falluja_mosque.jpg" hspace="4" align="left">Doubtless most of you have heard of the recent incident in a Falluja mosque, where a U.S. marine allegedly shot a wounded prisoner in the head at point-blank range. It was caught on video and aired (partially) on major U.S. networks. Obviously this is illegal (even if the insurgents are not <i>franc-tireur</i>), and the soldier at the center of this has been removed from duty and may face charges. The biggest shame in all of this, however, is not the killing of the prisoner, or the possible trial and imprisonment of the marine, it's that any of this had to happen in the first place - that young men barely twenty have been denied their youth and have been forced into this sickening world of fear and death and have their lives be under constant threat. It is no wonder they are making mistakes and are standoffish with Iraqis, they're probably sick to death from fear. The rules of warfare have been thrown away. It is hard to blame the marine's action; a day before the incident, one of his comrades was killed by explosives stuffed in a dead insurgent's body - the type of attacks American troops are facing daily across Iraq. "<i>Everybody who looks daily into the cold eye of death and gazes on so many dead faces bearing the stamp of suffering and renunciation, becomes certainly callous, but also old, very very old.</i>"</p>

<p>Can we say with full conviction that this is a justified war?</p>

            <p>Not to mention, that soldier who shot that Iraqi, has a bullet wound  after he was shot in THE FACE only a day or two before.  He's obviously going to have some form of psychological trauma when given the situation of his frend dying in a similar situation, and then also being shot in the face. </p>

<p>I feel bad for both parties in this situation.  Obviously for the man who died while apparantly injured.  But also for the soldier, who is taught that an injured soldier is the most dangerous.  Presented that situation a week ago, before someone in his troop died, and before getting shot in the face, I don't believe any of that video capture would of occured.  The whole reasoning behind starting this war of course should not of occured, cause it's been a mess from the start.</p>

            <p>The last I headr- We have lost over 39 soldiers on this assault in Falluja. And then you watch footage, read an article or see pictures and what you see isn't a city at all. Its a collection of rubble resembling buildings. The people have fled-that is, the people who didn't stay to fight. When you simplify the war in Iraq in such a way it seems easier to make sense of. Were fighting for cities with people who don't want us there. They have nothing-and yet they still fight. Which to me implies they will not stop-unless they are all dead, ( and even then that won't stop them from wanting Americans dead or occupying their country) Im not sure about anyone else- But I know that I don't believe the lives of our men & women are worth losing over such a thing. Especially when we aren't there for the reasons we were told they were going for. War is bad enough-A war based on a lie is some how worse than that.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, Seymour Hersh would agree with you: he lays very little blame on the young men and women responsible for the abuse at Abu Ghraib; rather, he mourns the fact that these young reservists were put in charge of a prison full of captured Iraqis, then prosecuted to the full extent of the law -- while the officers in charge and the administration itself, who knew about the abuse and did nothing until the story broke, stand blameless and free.</p>

            <p>What I hate is all the coverups.  Sure abu gharib and the one we are talking about now, none of this would of been reported or changed or known if a reporter of some sort didn't notify the world.  Then everyone in the US who is saying "HOW CAN THEY DO THAT AND GET AWAY WITH IT" are prompting the govenrment to do something bcause of the public outcry.  THe government shouldn't be allowing this to occur in the first place of course, but I hate how the media then blows it up into something to try and teach a lesson.  The fact of the matter is, War in itself is an ugly, dirty rotten thing.  When people see it on tv, they are "shocked and awed" by the destruction we cause.  They are horrorified to think that their children, could be involved in such a situation, that degrades, belittles injures and takes human life.  We are breeding this with coverups and this "we're better than you" mentality.  That mentality led to some inhumane and degrading things occuring , but the sheer fact that this is war, and those ignorant people who decided this was a good idea, are the same people who are complaining about censoring war.  </p>

<p>That upsets me greatly.    You say "kill em all", then you say "stop doing that, i don't want to see it, i just want the job done".  Shame on you.</p>

            <p>While I shouldn't be surprised, I can't believe that people still say this war should never have occured. The majority of Americans supported this war, and continue to support it. They reelected the President who made decision to invade, and thats that.</p>

<p>War is not pretty. It never has been. If there are war crimes, they should be brought to light. But what happened with that Marine is not one. All you have to do is compare the coverage of this between CNN and FOX News. One channel has the big voice over asking "Is this a war crime?" and goes on to interview people that believe it is, and the other explains the circumstances surrounding the incident. Tell me which one is more honest?</p>

<p>In fact, just yesterday I talked to a few conservative friends who said that if this Marine is tried and convicted of any wrongdoing, that they would lead a revolt against the government. While a bit extreme, at least they lvoe America and are willing to fight for her rather than just pack up and leave for a Socialist coutnry to the North or socialists countries across the pond.</p>

<p>The sad thing about Iraq and Fallujah is that we could have spared many lives by launching this assault of Fallujah months ago, but couldn't because of politics. In times of war, politics should not play into decision making. The casualties suffered in such a major attack are always hard to take, but if they are in the months leading up to a Presidential election, they could affect the outcome. Whoever decided to hold off the Fallujah fight until after the election should no longer have a job if they put politics before smart wartime tactics.</p>

<p>The war against terrorism, whether in Afghanistan or Iraq, is a new type of war. America and the coalition are experiencing growing pains as we go along and grow accustomed to this new type of war. There will be mistakes along the way, and the rules will need to change. The most dangerous enemy is a wounded one is true, and when you are fighting against people, excuse me, animals, who on a daily basis kill their own friends and neighbors, blow themselves up in order to kill innocent folks, and savagely behead innocent civilians, then you h<br />
ave to fight them in a way that will work. I am not saying we must lower ourselves to the level of animals that they are at, but we cannot fight a conventional war against an unconventional foe.</p>

<p>The American people need to continue to show solidarity on this front, and learn a lesson from Vietnam. John Kerry's actions when he returned hurt far more than they helped. The soldiers overwelmingly supported in the election and continue support President Bush as their Commander-in-Chief, and the American people need to continue to support the troops and their leader.</p>

            <p>Ryan, how could we have spared lives by launching this attack earlier?  We spared lives because we gave them time to evacuate.  Had we rushed in there to take care of the job, dropping 500 lb bombs on people's homes, the death toll would be absurd.  Though some of these so called "animals" and i do hope you mean the terrorists, bcause they are all not terrorists, did happen to evacuate as well, but the death toll is far far less than what it would of been had they not waited.  Fighting in Iraq has opened a pandora's box of bloodshed.  Don't think that by fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan that any of this is helping against the terrorist cause.  The terrorists you should be afraid of are the ones thatare already living here in America.  The guys who bombed us on 9/11 were living in Maine when they got the orders to attack and flew out of Logan.  Once again, I reitterate this war should not of happened.  Afghanistan yes, becasue we're chasing Osama bin Laden, but why in the hell did we decide to bomb Iraq?  Because of WMD's?  WHAT WMD'S?</p>

            <p>First, I am convinced that at least some of the WMDs were smuggled out of Iraq before the war, either to Syria or Iran, or both.</p>

<p>Second, while I have my own opinions about giving them time to evacuate, what I meant by saving lives by going in earlier is this. If we had gone into Fallujah when the insurgency was beginning, yes, we would have lost many soldiers in the battle for Fallujah and some civilian casualties, but we would have cut the insurgency off at the head. This would hae prevented some, if not many of the lives that have been lost in the last year.</p>

<p>The insurgency only lasts as long as they think we don't have the resolve to continue. The half-assed attempt at Fallujah earlier this year, and the subsequent withdrawal, cost us major points. So, my point is, we should have gone into Fallujah earlier to cut off the insurgency at its conception, instead of allowing it to grow and fester for months until the election was decided. This would have spared the lives of both coalition soldiers and innocent Iraqis.</p>

            <p>In case you all forgot, the poor injured Iraqi had 1 day /1 hour before been firing directly at our soldiers. If he could have held up a grenade long enough, he would have had one in his hand ready to be released as a soldier approached. This is not civilized warfare, and they will kill every soldier they can before they are killed.  Remember John Kerry's bravery when he shot, in the back, the naked 12 year old in vietnam and got a medal for it, RAN FOR PRESIDENT ON IT. This is the media trying to rattle people by not focusing on the full story but only on the end of the story, namely our guy winning by not getting killed by a guy playing dead.</p>

            <p>It's amazing how we can justify war crimes.</p>

<p>We want to explain it away because as a society we refuse to accept that we could be in err.</p>

<p>The fact remains that a U.S. marine shot an unarmed, injured Iraqi prisoner, in the head, at point blank range. Nobody is justifying what the Iraqi was doing (and if he was even Iraqi) but this is just another prime example of a bad war gone worse.</p>

            <p>"Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out." </p>

<p>What do you expect? All they tell you is that a soldier shot a 'raqui at point blank range even though the guy was unarmed and injured. Big deal. If it was the other way around do you think the 'raqui would have spared the US soldiers life? Hell no. You want to talk about war crimes, how about invading Iraq for no reason. Doesn't that count as one? Meaningless war will lead to meaningless killing. No one should expect any less. </p>

            <p>I will say that it is an historical irony that we separate war from "war crimes" - that we have determined that certain atrocities are acceptable, while othes are not.  Necessary, understandable - but still ironic.</p>

<p>On another note, Silva, in his somewhat muddled comment below, has just quoted the movie "Hackers."  No further comment.</p>

            <p>Let me also respond to the inimitable DA's comment that "this is not civilized warfare," a sentiment supported by the apparently unacceptable manner in which the Iraqi soldier wanted to kill as many people as he could before he died.</p>

<p>As if one of our ruddy-necked Skoal-sucking boys wouldn't have done the exact same thing.  As if they're not playing Drowning Pool's "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor" when they roll through Iraqi streets.  These Americans are  for the most part our age or younger, and not as well educated.  They are certainly not doing this because they believe in democratizing Iraq.  They are following orders and enjoying the moral ease with which one can operate when one has a set, definitive enemy on which to place the burden of the world's ills.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, these Iraqis are fighting because they have nothing to lose, because they have a problem with a Western superpower invading their country, such as it was, unprovoked.  They are fighting for their lives, and their families', particularly as the U.S. has shown no mercy towards these "insurgents."</p>

<p><br />
To them, we're the Nazis, we're the grim-eyed conquerors who despise everything about them.  And yes, they want us dead as much as our soldiers want them dead.  The only difference being that after it's all over, our survivors go back to hearth and home, and theirs, if there are any, have lost everything that ever meant anything to them.  </p>

<p>Rebellion, apparently, is only okay when it was 228 or so years ago and perpetrated by rich white men against a monarchy.  When those with darker skin and a different creed bring up the rallying cry of revolution against what amounts to a tyrannical power, we refuse to understand.  </p>

<p>Democracy may be an ideal worth fighting for, but it must be a fight fought by the people of the nation in which it is at question.  Democracy, fundamentally, cannot be imposed, or it is not true democracy.  Even if we are to ignore the obvious self benefits Bush has incurred by going to war, and believe his half-hearted desires for democracy in Iraq, we must be prepared to realize that perhaps the Middle East is simply not ready for our vision of government.  And given that that vision is itself drastically flawed, who are we to call it the best?</p>

<p>I guess you come to this conclusion because our soldiers coming home from Vietnam were welcomed with open arms. I think you missed the stories from the history books of soldiers coming home to hatred from those that hated the war. You would have us believe these guys come home to a better life just because they were in war. </p>

<p>In terms of rebellion only being ok for us is a ridiculous notion. Liberals are the first ones calling for our involvement in other local uprisings like Haiti. You make it sound like these  "insurgents," a media term I never liked because it denotes that these are all Iraqi nationals, are the voice of all Iraqi's which they most certainly are not. If they had their way Iraq would turn back to rule by despot. They hold onto what ever power they have by instilling fear into those around them. Afraid to trust us because the UN would not allow Bush Sr. to remove Sadam and instead forced us withdraw allowing  him to hold power. They fear we will do the same the thing now. </p>

<p>The beauty of democracy is that it allows the people control. If they want to hand power back to a governmental body they can, and while I would hope they don't it would be the choice of the people. Democracy may be flawed but that is why we don't have a democracy in this country. We have a Democratic Republic.  Also not perfect, but there is no system I would prefer. And it seems there are plenty of people knocking on our doors, and sneaking though the cracks( or should I say gaps) in the wall.</p>

            <p>So about that trip to London in March.....</p>

<p>How about this.....</p>

<p>London 3 days + 3 days in one of the following ... Stockholm, Vienna, Berlin, Geneva, Milan, Rome, Venice </p>

<p>Not that those are the only cities worth going to, just cities i'm interested in seeing that I haven't been to yet.</p>

<p>Since San Fran is now out of the question (exfactor), I am doubling my efforts for Europe 05, thanks</p>
