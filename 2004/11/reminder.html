            <p>I, like the President, look forward to working with you, the Democrats and supportors of John Kerry. Its going to be a wonderful next 4 years, and I do look forward to working with you all on the other side of the aisle as we work to crush terrorism, strengthen our economy, bring healthcare to more Americans, and improve the education of our children. We are ready to step up to the plate and put aside our partisan differences in order to move America forward. Will you join us?</p>

<p>Ok, <br />
Don't you understand that we have much different (better) ways of solving each every one of those problems.  With Republicans controlling the House, Senate, White House, Supreme Court, World, Galax.......we certainly don't plan on letting you run all over us.  </p>

<p>After we strongarm Israel into fighting Iran for us, maybe then people will realize the wrong decision was made.</p>

<p>Or maybe after 2 million more jobs are lost, or after the next terrorist attack, or after seniors are still having to make the choice between food or medicine....</p>

<p>This is where we, as Democrats, have to come together.  We must regroup, reorganize and get back to our base (the Average American!).  Now is the time for real Democrats to show their colors and stand up and be ready to fight for another four years.  No more latte liberals.  No more rich Hollywood a-holes.  No more whining.</p>

<p>This is war.</p>

<p>Who's with me?</p>

            <p>No one. You are done. The party is over. You will see a civil war within the democrats, and you will be the monority party for the next 20 years. One of the branches will be slightly left and not so fanatical. It will attract away some of the Republicans in the center.  All the while we will move more to the right and finally do away with the America haters on extreme left... and then I woke up. At least Michael Moore will have to come up with a new target for his attacks instead of the same old shit. </p>

            <p>The Democrats have been looking for their hear and their soul - they have been looking for a winning message - they have been looking for anything to get them back on the winning path since the 1994 Republican takeover. THEY HAVE FAILED!  In two consecutive elections now, Democrats have lost seats in the House, lost seats in the Senate, and now failed to regain the White House.</p>

<p>Democrats do not need to regroup. They need to disband. The Republican Party has now secured its control on the U.S. government for a generation. The Democrat party as we know it will now cease to exist. Terry McAulifffe will go down as the most ineffective and destructive DNC Chair in history.  Instead of a messy civil war inside the party, you should instead bury the party and start from scratch.</p>

            <p>BTW Brian - Are you saying that the Republican Party and Bush Campaign successfully deceived 59,017,382 voters into voting for them?</p>

<p> First, I think you give us way too much credit. Second, the Democrats are not going to rise from the ashes by calling the electorate stupid and naive for trusting a president that has kept them safe and  led them through an economic downturn.</p>

<p>The campaign of doom and gloom is over. It lost. The American people did not fall for it. Get over it and move on.</p>

            <p>The numbers don't lie (well unless Karl Rove is behind the election)....buuuuut....</p>

<p>You guys did/are still doing a great job of making at least half of those (those making under 200K [I'm not sure of the exact numbers]) 59,017,382 vote for you, when they have no tangible reason to vote for Bush.... </p>

<p>(tangible meaning more jobs, more money, less sons and daughters in the military)</p>

<p>The fact is, those people would benefit from a President and a party in control that would increase services within the country, relieve the economy by investing in people, wager a more united global war on terror and fix both the healtcare and Social Security problems....</p>

<p>It is certainly a marvel to study and understand why so many people would vote for someone who has done so little for the country</p>

I am not saying the majority of the electorate is dumb or naive....</p>

<p>That has been a MAJOR problem with the Dems of late....the fact is, we have to win those people back from you, b/c you guys have done such a good job of dumbing down your message to get the votes...</p>

            <p>I have spent 4 years of my life being upset and motivated against Bush and  his lies, his racism and sexist notions. My entire high school career will have been a never ending struggle for Democrats, democracy, truth and equality. Now, after 14 months of supporting either Dean or Kerry- I must do it all over again. Another four years- except this time I will be in college and I will be able to vote. This is what I know. What I don't know is...how America has once again denied itself the truth and leadership it deserves. I am speechless, I cannot come to a conclusion that answers any of my questions for me. I am so sad. Sad for John Kerry and John Edwards. Sad for the people that worked so hard and so long for them. Sad for democracy and sad for America. At this point- I have no answers and I am in no mood to fight...yet. In the wise words of MLK..and Howard Dean..and Nick DeLena " Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter." In other words, Bush your still a pig a theif and a liar- and we will not give up uncovering the truth and fighting you every step of the way.</p>

            <p>My congratulations to Mr. Boehm for going two whole posts without resorting to nonsensical, propagandist, intolerant religious fallacy.  At least occasionally you're able to oppress your desire to call out thanks to Jeebus.  </p>

<p>And Europe isn't dying, by the way.  They've simply been through all this nonsense before: unjust, unfit, morally repugnant leaders willingly voted into power by the public who use that power to instill fear and confusion into the public in order to maintain control.  Leaders who convince the public that it's this  person who's our enemy, not that one, even though that one is the only one who has ever openly attacked us...why not that one?  Because finding and bringing that one to justice gets me and the rest of my bottom-feeding corporate whores nowhere economically.  </p>

<p>Welcome to four more years where two plus two equals five.  To four more years where people are discriminated against solely on the basis of their sexuality.  To four more years of this nation being increasingly saturated with the manipulative, pathetic, morally repugnant and ultimately meaningless dregs of religious faith.  To four more years of tax cuts for the top two percent.  To four more years of a brash, arrogant, ignorantly aggressive foreign policy.  To four more years of potential and actual infringements of codified American civil rights.  To four more years of fear of the other.  To four more years of disgusting American swagger.  To four more years of the perpetuation of a failed, flawed election system.  To four more years of tampering with the Constitution.  To four more years of the festering sore of neo-conservatism. </p>

<p>I don't know what's worse: that George W. Bush is aware of his skewed, biased, blatantly self-serving mores and does what he does anyway, or that he is honestly ignorant as to how disgusting a human being he is.</p>

<p>Welcome to four more years of the death of hope.</p>

Jim, how can you talk about morals when you denounce something that is the basis for all morals in our society today, religion.  The dems went wrong when assumed they were right and that religious people in this country were a fringe group. We are not, we are the majority, and you have to appeal to us in order to be elected to the highest office. You have to believe in a God, not just say you do. You have to have faith in the people of this country, not promise to deliver things we can deliver ourselves. We are an independent bunch, and we don't want your handouts. We want to make our living, provide for our families, and contribute to society without government telling us how to go about it. We want to contribute to charities we believe strongly about , we don't want the government taxing us into charity and giving our money to clean needles programs and abortions on demand. </p>

<p>These are the mainstream ideas.  Just because the media decides to hide these portrayales of society, it does not mean they don't exist.  The dems may not change, but if they don't they won't win.</p>

            <p>Amen!</p>

<p>More than any other concern ñ not job creation (20%), not terrorism (19%), not Iraq (15%) ñ voters in exit polls declared ìmoral valuesî their top priority (22%), and 80 percent of them backed President Bush. Those 20 million voters were at the heart of the presidentís reelection, which gave him new clout in pursuing his conservative agenda. Bush showed gains among Americans describing themselves as religious -- up 5 points among Catholics, up 6 points among Jewish voters. One of his biggest margins over Sen. John Kerry -- nearly 2 to 1 -- came among those who said they attend church more than once a week.</p>

<p>If Democrats want to win elections, especially Presidential contests, they are going to have to believe in God, and not be a John Kerry (calls himself Catholic, but doesn't act it).</p>

<p>And like Jay Severin said last night, Democrats are walking around with a duck on their head, and when people point and laugh, they look at everything on themselves except for the duck. Democrats cannot win until they remove that duck. That duck is gay marriage, being against partial birth abortion (still can be pro-choice, just not stupid), and the complete removal of faith from government. Americans will never, ever endorse gay marriage, they will never accept the need for PBA, and they will always be faith-based. Until Democrats accept this fact, they will never win.</p>

            <p>Religion certainly played an important part in the development of human morality, but it is by no means the be all and end all of ethics; we have moved past it, philosophically.  </p>

<p>The fact that killing is wrong, for instance, is a moral tenet which can easily and completely be separated from any religious dogma.  </p>

<p>Additionally, religious morality, particularly that of Western religions (Christianity in general, Catholicism) is flawed: the Catholic Church denies women the right to  celebrate the mass and posits that man is created in God's image - woman a mere afterthought.  Not to mention that Catholicism has always, always supported and initiated persecution of those who do not share their beliefs - historically in very, very violent ways.</p>

<p>If your morality is based solely on religion, then you  might want to reconsider your ethical foundations.</p>

            <p>I find it extraordinarily ironic that this spectre of terrorism you seem to think is haunting the world is based, fundamentally, on fanatical, skewed religious belief - the same moral foundation the Bushian movement is attempting to use to combat it.  </p>

<p>  - Horrible example for someone that supports the killing of a baby when it is inconvienent for the mother. Won't bring up partial birth since I don't know your stance, but if it is anything like the ultra left beliefs you hold on everything I else, I assume you do?</p>

<p>" particularly that of Western religions(Christianity in general, Catholicism) "</p>

<p>  - So let me get this straight. Islam, which believes the entire non-islam world are infidels and should all burn in hell is more moral than the Christian faiths which believe in <br />

            <p>Islam and Christianity are together in holding as a fundamental tenet that non-believers are "infidels."</p>

<p>Pat Robertson: "It is interesting, that termites don't build things, and the great builders of our nation almost to a man have been Christians, because Christians have the desire to build something. He is motivated by love of man and God, so he builds. The people who have come into [our] institutions [today] are primarily termites. They are into destroying institutions that have been built by Christians, whether it is universities, governments, our own traditions, that we have.... The termites are in charge now, and that is not the way it ought to be, and the time has arrived for a godly fumigation.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament, God is recorded as  punishing ancient Israelite individuals and members of other tribes for following the wrong religion, or deviating from "proper" religious practices. In some cases, the  victims are viewed as having no right to continue living.</p>

<p>From the New Testament: 1 Corinthians 10:20-21 "But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils."</p>

            <p>Or you could use quotes from the Pope and Bishops and have some merit in your arguement. I am sure there are religous zelots out there all over the place in all religions. I have not studied Islam nor read about Islam to a sufficient extent to argue it's merits and shortfalls except to say, not one Islamic leader of any stature has denounced the actions of those acting in the name of Islam.  Meanwhile, the Pope, and 2 or 3 Popes before him, have opened the church up to much critism for being as open to outsiders as it has been since the second Vatican Council. The Church has gone as far as denouncing the war in Iraq.</p>

            <p>Not at all, Robinson is on the fringe of the Christian faith, just like Falwell and Hutton Gibson. The Bible is certainly not a book without gloom and doom and I don't think anyone would try to say it isn't. The central teaching in the Catholic faith comes from the gospels which of coarse are much less fire and brimstone oriented, and more life lesson oriented. The Letters to call out some of the harsher messages, but the interpretation is key. Unlike the Constitution, there is room for interpretation in the Bible.</p>
