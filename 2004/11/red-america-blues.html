            <p><i><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/real-us.gif" hspace="4" align="left">On CNN, David Gergen, a former top-level aide to both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, approached this cultural divide from an entirely different perspective: from that of blue-state liberals who canít believe what happened this week. "Thereís going to be a sense of alienation, a lot of isolation from the majority," Gergen said. He even went so far as to observe that many liberals are going to find themselves wondering "what kind of a country" theyíre living in.</i></p>

<p><i>Nowhere is that sense of isolation, of alienation, going to be felt more keenly than in Massachusetts, Kerryís home and the bluest of blue states. We live, after all, in the only state where same-sex marriage is legal, protected by the state constitution. It is a state that both Bushes bitterly mocked in their successful presidential campaigns, with George W. sneering that Kerry was a "Massachusetts liberal." Itís possible, of course, to make too much of this: 37 percent of Massachusetts voters cast their ballots against Kerry on Tuesday, just as 34 percent of Texas voters opposed Bush. There are plenty of red voters in blue states and blue in red. But for Massachusettsís urban, educated class ó the folks who work in medicine, higher education, or technology, live in or near the city, and value diversity ó what happened on Election Day was a terrible blow not just to their hopes for a Kerry victory, but to their very idea of what it means to be an American.</i></p>

            <p>Well. I've been wondering what kind of country I have been living in for almost three years. I did not need an election loss to start asking that question. Now, its turned into more of a " What is wrong with America." Or, " Why are 59 million people being so ignorant and blind?" Or even this one- " Why all of a sudden-are religious people the only ones with "'morals'", and why are the religious people looking for morals voting for a man who is clueless to what morals actually are?" Example of moral to which Bush doesn't know exists: Truth/Honesty. I am from Massachusetts-and I love it. And I am also furious with the Presidents remarks and cracks about this state. To be quite honest- I think that Romney should stand up and say something about that. He is, after all, our lovely governor. But he is also - a republican. So, he will not. But Finally- The blue states are the only states that have made the intelligent decision in this case. Go us!</p>

            <p>Well Mitt Romney really isn't from Massachusetts, and he's not a liberal, so he doesn't fit under that Massachusetts Liberal category.  Probably why he isn't standing up to say anything.  </p>

<p>Plus the guy wants to run for president eventually, he doesn't want to make a big scene on his day of glory. Sure sounds like a great idea for Romney to be president.  Imagine all the education and medical cuts?  How many teachers lost their jobs during his term so far?  How many schools are forced to have 50+ children inside of their classrooms?  </p>

<p>Conservatism at it's best, no child behind baby, oh ya.  No child behind because their all cramped up in one room with one teacher who doesn't have enough time in the day to tend to each student individually.  Therefore leaving the kids to play "Catch - up" and yet, somehow.... their not being left behind.... go figure, go republican, 4 more years!  woo can't wait.</p>

            <p>I have never heard of a single class size in the 50's. </p>

<p>Class size is a meaningless metric invented over the past 10 years. When we went to the wonderful public schools we had class sizes averaging 30-36 kids. My high school class sizes where similarly high with the exception of AP Chem which only had about 25.  I like to think I managed to get a good education because my parents would be on me to get my homework done and keep my grades up . </p>

<p> Students who needed  individualized attention always got it when we were growing up only about 15 years ago. The reason is less students needed the attention , and those that did need it, didn't need it because they had a discipline problem. If your kid is an a-hole, he should be left behind, or you should get him in line.  Parents like to believe their kids are wonderful putting the responsibility of raising kids on teachers, when the teacher's  job is to educate kids.  These are the kids that are bogging down the system today, and the public education system was never formed to handle it.</p>

            <p>For someone who supports the "NO CHILD left behind" routine, you sure do speak like you want to leave the "tough ones" behind.  Sure those ones need more work, but it doesn't mean you give up on them and make them remain on their current path to destruciton.  As a teacher you are there to teach, and give every kid a chance, even if he hs a disicipline problem, it may not be his fault.    What if he has a learning disability?  My brother has one, you think as a family member, I want to see my brother fail because no one wanted to give him the time?  How is that fair?    How does a parent get a kid in line when he has a phsyical or mental or even an emotional issue debilitating him from performing as well as his peers?  My mom did everything for my brother, basically relearning middle and high school with him just about every night.  Sure my brother had to stay back a couple of years and is graduating at the age of 19, is it his fault?  no, he had phsyical problems that led to him missing alot of school and requiring alot of time under anaesthetic because he was being operated on actually giving him a short term memory problem.  I give my brother alot of credit, he worked pretty hard to get where he is today, and now hopefully he's going to further his education..  </p>

<p>Sure Public school is tough, and some of the toughest eggs to cook are found here, but you can't give up and say "ok Public school offers less, so give them less" that goes against every moral standard you can think of.  Just because you come from a less privlaged community, and Revere I think applies as one, you should be given every opportunity to come out of there with a top notch education, no matter your personality, race religion or creed.  No child left behind baby, you thought it up, you ought to run through with it, and stop cutting teachers and educational funding.</p>

<p>I'll step off my soap box now.</p>

            <p>I think you kind of argued my point. Your mom didn't hand your brother off to the public schools and say here you go, now he's your problem. She got involved and made sure he was had the support at home to get through what he needed to at school. Obviously I am not arguing that no one has a learning disability. But I think the rapid rise in use of prescription drugs among children has given parents to many excuses for what would otherwise be considered bad parenting.</p>

            <p>I don't see it as best to keep everyone in their own little circle of 10-20 kids with a teacher for the year. There is a real world at the end the tunnel and kids need to be prepared to do the work that needs to be done. </p>

            <p>I actually prepared a large reply to your post dom last nite, where i stated some key figures, and even admitted i'd buy a bottle of greygoose if you could convince me otherwise, but I've lost the entire argument i wrote up, and the motivation to pursue writing another one.  </p>

<p>I did make a good mention about Mr. Cerrone, and how he was laid off.  How he made you feel like a friend but helped you like he was a parent, and you could relate with him, but due to educational cutbacks, the AC Whelan lost arguably it's best teacher that year in 4th grade.  How many kids got stuck with Mr. Navarro and Mr. Miller, who i believe later lost his job as well?  Those poor souls after us will never  realize how great Mr. Cerrone was.  And that's sad.</p>

            <p>I don't think we are talking about cutbacks as much as we are talking about throwing good money after bad. There are plenty of studies out there showing that per capita sepnding in the city schools, including Boston, is considerably higher than it is in the suburbs but that results lag far behind. Spending for the sake of spending is not the answer. Finding good teachers is the answer, and using Mr. Cerone as an example, why was he let go before say Mr. Pacella who taught basically nothing, or Mrs. Lanza who was a complete bitch. (Let's not forget the other asshole English teacher at the Garfield, who's name escapes me.) The answer is that Mr. Cerone didn't have the senority over those other teachers so he was automatically first on the cutting block. The unions of coarse see nothing wrong with this because<br />
 the leadership int he union are all senior teachers.  The teachers don't speak up because they want to stay in good standing with the unions. </p>

<p>The first thing that has to happen before we will ever be able to improve the public  education system in this country is to fire the unions. They work contrary to the interests of the students and are by design flawed to keep ineffective teachers in place while pushing away the good teachers like Cerone who just want to teach.</p>

            <p>That last argument is completely without merit.  Spending in city schools is higher than in the suburbs, yet the results in the former are inferior to the latter?  No shit.  Did you consider at all the fact that per capita income in cities is far lower than in most suburbs?  That there are more students by far, who have far harder lives than suburbanites?</p>

<p>You find it strange that schools in Weston, the richest municipality in the state, per capita, would have better results than Boston even though more money is spent on Boston schools?  </p>

<p>You assume that all students are created equal, when they are not, just as you assume that everyone has equal opportunites, when they do not.</p>

<p>And there is no such thing as useless spending when it comes to education.  I would dump billions of dollars into education before I would ever dream of spending another cent on the military, for instance.</p>

            <p>#1 - More money to education does not work, has never worked, and will not work. It is where the money is spent and how that matters. Teachers unions are the biggest enemy of good education.</p>

<p>#2 - Despite #1, if you don't fund the military and instead throw billions at education, it  is pointless since the schools will have been destroyed by terrorists, Iran, or North Korea.</p>

<p>#3 - President Bush needs to return to traditional conservative/Republican ideals and remove education completely from the Federal government.</p>

            <p>What Jim was trying to point out (JIm, correct me if I'm wrong here) is...</p>

<p>Urban kids, on average, are from a household with a lower household income, therefore a lower education level of parents....</p>

<p>Who is going to be able to support their children more? The single mother/father working two jobs who isn't home to see her/his child doing their homework</p>

<p>or...</p>

<p> William Weston, who makes 150k and whose wife stays home and has the milk and cookies ready for Johnny when he comes home from school to do his homework....</p>

<p>Although this is an extreme example...I believe its more than relevant....</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to have my mother home, asking me about school, interested in what I was doing and making sure I did all that was expected of me school-wise....</p>

<p>and had i not had that support, I probably wouldnt have gone to college....</p>

            <p>Not to mention....</p>

<p>School systems with plenty of local money (ie Weston) are able to attract a much different (better) crop of young teachers.....</p>

<p>If you were a teacher, where would you rather go?</p>

<p>Weston or Revere....</p>

<p>The problem isnt how much money should be spent, or where it should be spent (I belive the latter is more important out of the two), but the point is that there is an unequal starting point for kids in suburbs as opposed to kids in urban areas.....</p>

<p>The responsibility has to be put on the parents....and this responsibility should be rewarded....</p>

<p>How about a tax cut (instead for the wealthiest 2%) to parents of children who graduate high school, or college........</p>

            <p>I believe all current tax cuts should remain, but giving tax breaks to parents of college students is definately something I would favor greatly. First, they were successful in getting their children through high school. Second, they brought them up in a way that explained to them that college is the next logical step. And three, paying for college these days is so tough on so many families, that a tax break for tuition paying parents would be a great reward for good parenting.</p>

            <p>My mother and father had a sub shop while I went through elementary and middle school. Suffice it to say, they were rarly at home when I got out of school.  My grandfather was always there, but wasn't over my shoulder helping with math problems and asking about tests I had coming up. My mother got involved in the PTA on weekends and made sure to stay somewhat involved, but I only got a general warning about doing my work. I don't think there has to be someone there to walk you through everything you do in school. Most certainly not when you get to the high school level. </p>

<p>As far as teacher pay, Revere schools pay their teachers (and police but that's another story) at one of the highest rates in the state last time I checked. There are also new incentives to attract teachers to the urban schools. </p>

<p>The last piece of information you ignore is the state contribution to the schools systems which is much higher per student in boston than it is for weston.</p>

            <p>Can you please just admit (regardless of free will, which plays a big part in this discussion about kids in school)...a child in Weston with wealthy supportive parents has a much better chance of succeeding academically than a minority urban student w<br />
ith a single parent or two parents working two jobs apiece...</p>

<p><br />
Obviously, this argument boils down to parenting, which we can discuss another time...the way we were raised has almost everything to do with the people we become and the success we have...</p>

<p>Of course there are stories of the urban minorities who, through free will, decide they are going to make a better situation for themselves...but percentage wise, how many actually make it? and then compare that to those in Weston?....</p>

<p>There is no denying the fact that those who grow up in better living situations will be more apt to success in school....</p>

<p>as for the tax cut....there is a certain committment that attenting a college institution a kid and their  family must make....especially the middle class....it might be hard for joey bagofdonuts to open his own garage, but even int hat case, joey might want to take some management classes before opening that garage... rather than tan and drink iced coffee</p>

<p>and you still didnt answer the question...in all honesty, where would you rather teach?</p>

            <p>The reason for the higher state contribution in boston is most likely tied to the fact that weston is (again, im assuming here) that weston is a self sufficient community....they dont need the states money to afford new schools, William Weston's property tax on the two million dollar 3 bedroom ranch is paying for that....</p>

            <p>First I would rather teach in Revere, the pay is better and my ride to work would be about 3 minutes. But, I would never be a teacher so you are asking the wrong person.</p>

<p>"Of course there are stories of the urban minorities who, through free will, decide they are going to make a better situation for themselves...but percentage wise, how many actually make it? and then compare that to those in Weston?...."</p>

<p>You are saying they can make it as long as the decide to make it. Putting more money into a school in hopes the kids there will decide to study and make life better for themselves is never going to work.  The only place this will ever come from is home. I can't see giving  Susie Someville $100 to tell her kid to go to school, she should be able to tell him that on her own.</p>

<p>And to your question, a childwith supportive parents in Roxbury  has a better chance to make it in school than a child of parents that are never home in Weston, why is that the governments problem when the government can't take these parents by the hand and make sure they support their kids?</p>
