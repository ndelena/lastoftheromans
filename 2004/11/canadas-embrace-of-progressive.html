The latest website is <a href="http://www.canadianalternative.com" target="_new">Canadian Alternative</a>.</p>

<p>The site says: <i>"We invite you to get to know Canada," the site says. "Explore the richness and diversity of our regions. And find out why Canada is the perfect alternative for conscientious, forward-thinking Americans."</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Reasons to move to Canada, as cited by www.canadianalternative.com:

<p>1. Canada has universal public health care.</p>

<p>2. Canada has no troops in Iraq.</p>

<p>3. Canada signed the Kyoto Protocol environmental treaty.</p>

<p>4. More than half of Canada's provinces allow same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>5. The Canadian Senate recommends legalizing marijuana.</p>

<p>6. Canada has no law restricting abortion.</p>

<p>7. Canada has strict gun laws and relatively little violence.</p>

<p>8. The United Nations has ranked Canada the best country to live in for eight consecutive years.</p>

<p>9. Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976.</p>

<p>10. Canada has not run a federal deficit since 1996-97. </p><br />

<p>"Progressive, prosperous, inclusive: feel at home in Canada."<br />
I really believe that Canada is becoming more American than America.</p>

            <p>I think the talk of moving is a little silly...are we really prepared to just pack it in and let the right wing win?...I definitely see moving as a sign of weakness</p>

<p>Where's the fun in moving to a place that completely agrees with you?...Sure it would be nice, but it would get old quick...</p>

<p>also, what about the fight for a greater good?...we all know that our ideas and policies would be more effective and make the country/world a much better place, so why quit?...moreover, why let the right fly the world's only superpower into the ground...</p>

<p>finally, when all the focus on morals and religions wears off, will there be anything better than seeing the face of all the  right wing religious nutbags who thought the left would wither away and die....</p>

            <p>PRO - I think it would be great if all the liberal abortionist sodomite Communist atheistswould leave this country and go to either Canada or Eupope. that would officially declare the Conservative government 'government for life.' We would finally be left alone to create the perfect America, where free speech is truly free, old women are allowed to protect themselves with guns, we can allow more legal immigrants in because we have finally stopped illegal aliens from coming, we finally give unborn children the right to life that the Constitution guarantees and we all enjoy, marriage (and children) will be protected from sexual deviants, and people will be allowed to celebrate whatever religion they want without being labeled bigots and homophobes.</p>

<p>CON - I have many friends that are liberal abortionist sodomite Communist atheists, and I enjoy their company. America thrives on its differences, and the debate of ideas and policies. While I think many of these friends' ideas are completely and totally wrong and backwards, they are free to have them and continue to support them. But, if they do stay, they must respect the President for being democratically elected. They can loudly disagree with him on policy issues, but when the nation is at war, discretion must be excercised. They should also not denigrate the people that reelected him, but instead attempt to show them why your side is better. We can all live<br />
 here together peacefully. But, if you decide to leave, I'll help you pack.</p>

            <p>This article was great in cnn.com.</p>

<p>Though I can officially become a Canadian citizen at any point in my life (since my mother is a canadian national) and thought about it for a time when I had no insurance and wanted to capitalize on the free social healthcare in case of emergency, I don't know if I could ever live in Canada.  It's a beautiful country, I'd have a throng of family and friends immediately upon my arrival, and I love Hockey, but it's so damn cold, and there are a lot of job problems in Canada, which is all I ever hear from my family who lives there.  It's a much simpler life, and I believe anyone could capitalize in the country if they went there with that "Go Gettem" American attitude, but in all honestly who wants to live in 6-8 months of winter a year and constantly looking for a job?</p>

<p>Though, I have to admit, I would love to go to Cuba someday.  Might have to get a Canadian passport just for that reason.</p>

            <p>Well, only parts of Canada experience colder weather than we do. Vancouver for example has a warmer winter with less snow (but a cooler summer). </p>

<p>I wasn't suggesting we all move up there (even if I did I'd vote absentee ballot). But... it's nice to see a country that successfully implements all the policies we desire. And what, they're not a poor bloated Socialist Oblast?!</p>

<p>Actually Tom I got the heads up on the article at BBC News. And we have a lot of job problems here too (I think I can vouch personally for that.)</p>

            <p>Yeah, but you don't have a degree in Computer Science and are working as a waiter ( My cousin Manny).  You don't have a PHD in Chiropracting, and you are considered a Doctor by not one, but two countries (US and Canada) and yet, you are working at a Butcher shop to get by(My uncle Alphonso)</p>

<p>That's the kind of problems i'm talking about.  Job like this are at an all time low there.  Yet, menial jobs like factory assembly line work is abundant ask my cousin cathy and her husband who both work for a ford parts plant.  I can't tell you how many of my family have worked for the local steel mill in Hamilton, only to see one of the big two go out of business and then lose all their jobs.   They didn't work there because they were good in Steel work, they went there for the employment.  Work in general up there is tough to come by, at least in southern Ontario.   Toronto makes out pretty well of course, but for my family, it's about the same kind of commute you'd have going from Boston to Auburn, out just beyond Worcester.  It's a tough commute as you can imagine.  Thankfully for them unemployment benefits are very good, and cost of living is rediculously cheap.  For example.. my cousin Frank bought a 4 bedroom brand new condo for 60,000 Canadian.  And Cathy and her hubbie bought a brand new 3 bedroom house with garage and pool for 150,000 canadian. </p>

<p>What happens in Vancouver, well i'm not exactly sure, though everyone in Canada refers to it like the Mecca of all that is Canada.  I'll have to go there myelf to figure that out.</p>

            <p>No offense, but i had this problem with my wrist before, it was a bad pinched nerve problem, whenever i moved my wrist up or down too much, it would be extremely painful and restrict movement.  My uncle looked at it once when I was at his house, put his thumb on a spot, said "does that hurt?" i said "OW YA" he then grabs my wrist, and flicks it up and down like a violent hand shake twice, my wrist snaps, all pain is gone.  </p>

<p>No offense but i'd pay for that ability.</p>

            <p>Chiropracty as a field is little more credible than astrology and has little if any acceptance among modern medical practitioners. </p>

<p>That aside, the Canadian unemployment rate (7.1%) is only roughly 1.6% higher than that of the United States (5.5% as of 10/2004). That is well within the margins you'll see from state to state(MA unemployment is 4.6%, Louisiana 6.0%), so statistically speaking it's not exceptionally significant. Canadian government statistics (http://www.statcan.ca) reports the highest unemployment rate among 15-24 year olds, with less than a Bachelors degree. So, also, statistically, we are in a less vulnerable demographic.</p>

            <p>If our unemployment were to rise to 7% you woould be the first to put all the blame on Bush and say how terrible it is. I forget the actual number of people we count as workers but assuming it is 100 Million, your insignificant 1.6% is roughly 1.6 million jobs lost. </p>

<p>Let's all get real, you people aren't moving, some would say unfortunetly. This is the best place in the world to live even if you do disagree with the current majority. Everyother country in the world uses the US as a benchmark. Excluding the US, California alone is the number 3 or 4 economy in the world. The US is by far the largest.  The EU is simply a route for Europe to become a second world power, but it won't work because they are more divided on policy than the Left and Right in America are.</p>

            <p>I never said that a 7% unemployment rate was acceptable, I just said that it's within the margins we've experienced domestically (the U.S. had a rate that high as recently as 1992). </p>

<p>Yes, California is huge. And votes Democrat. As do the majority of prosperous states.</p>

            <p>Since when does truth in science have anything to do with why someone would want to leave this country. The THEORY of evolution is all well and good to be taught as  a theory that has not been proven along with the other valid theories, such as Creationism.</p>

<p>Evolution is an issue, much like homosexual marriage (and homosexuality in general), that should not be taught in school because it is a values-based topic. Parents should be able to teach their children the truth on issues such as homosexuality and evolution without worrying that by having their kids attend public school, that they will be taught  a liberal, secular philosophy that is not by any means a proven fact.</p>

<p>Jim, would I be correct in saying that the real motivation for your crusade against Christianity and Catholicism in particular is the fact that you were 'forced' to believe when you were a child? Is this the manifestation of a youthful desire to revolt against authority? To be honest, you are one of the most anti-Christian, anti-Catholic people I have ever met. I am taken aback every time you rip into God and Christ, and the people that believe in both, not because you believe differently, which I respect, but because of  the utter disregard and intolerance of opposing views that you hold.</p>

            <p>How can you view chiropracting and put it in the same sentence as astrology?  It's as much a medical field as a pediologist (foot doctor).  They specialize n joints and bones and are professionals in the workings of the spine.  It's a completely valid form of physical therapy!  When people get whiplash in a car accident, they go to a chiropractor to get checked and given treatment.    </p>

<p>It's not some yahoo who thinks tarot cards and crystal ball's hold the future for us all because it's apparantly up in the stars for some connect the dot mystique in the sky.  It's not some chicken liver miracle practice.  It's what it is, it's cracking joints, adjusting bones, and relieving tension and pain.  If you really think that it holds no bearing at all in the medical field, then that's obviously because you never went to one before.</p>

            <p>Chiropractic is not a valid medical field. Most doctors frown upon it. I don't think you even need a degree to be a so-called "chiropractor." If a person that is in an accident goes to their PCP, they would never recommend chiropractic. They would recommend a spine and neck doctor with a medical degree. Come on Tom, you know this. Chiropractic, yes it works for some, but there have also been multiple lawsuits over it. Additionally, many people have been scammed into believing that the treatment they were receiving was the reason for their supposed recovery, when it really had nothing to do with. Chiropractic belongs in the same category as astrology, for sure.</p>

            <p>Mr. "I use the web like a madman" over here.</p>

<p>sorry if i seem so edgy about my uncle's achievements, the guy is my personal role model.  THough i may not be up to date on my medical terminology, you are probably better than i am with your latin 101 experience.  SPQR</p>

<p>My uncle moved in with me for 7 years after he got laid off by a steel company in Hamilton.  He came to my house for vacation and didn't leave.  He never had a high school diploma, so he got a GED, then his associates at North Shore Community when he then transferred took a break, and eventually moved out to Iowa to get his bachelors and then eventually his doctorate at a chiropracting school out there.</p>

<p>To see my uncle basically go from nothing to something was a huge motivational lift for myself.  However he's not making due with that as of right now since he's been working at a butcher shop for hte past year with this insane amount of knowledge in his head.  He became a chiropractor because he hurt his neck in a car accident and went to a chiropractor, after a year of therapy he felt alot better, and was interested in the field.  </p>

<p>So, it's somewhat offensive to hear you belittle it as something as small and rediculous as astrology, since alot more is involved in this than the age of aquarius.</p>

            <p>Well, Tom, I think your uncle may be the exception to the rule. While stereotyping is wrong and should not be done, generalizations are perfectly acceptable if they are true. In general, chiropractic programs are not accredited. Practicing chir<br />
opractic and having a recognized degree in it are two different things. While it is becoming a more accepted profession, it still has a way to go. And like Nick said, its an unregulated and arbitrary profession that has a few select individuals who know what they are doing and have PhDs in a sea of scam-artists and amateurs.</p>

            <p>THE UN NEEDS TO GO?  What?  How can you call yourself a human being?  Fifty years of international progress should be eradicated?  Fifty years of humanitarianism and supreme efforts, successful or not, to keep the peace?  Fucking fascists.  Let's just abolish international travel too, as well as prohibiting the speaking of foreign tongues within American borders.  Anybody up for burning a few Jews?</p>
