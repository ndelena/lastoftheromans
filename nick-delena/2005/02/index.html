        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/jeff-gannon.jpg" hspace="4" align="left">"Jeff Gannon," a White House correspondent for <a href="http://www.talonnews.com" target="_new">Talon News</a>, was outed this past week as a fraud, a ringer lobbing softballs in press conferences, and interestingly, a gay male prostitute. </p>

<p>I'm not even kidding.</p>

<p>His name is actually James D. Guckert</p>

<p>The story behind Talon News is equally interesting. It's headed by Bobby Eberle and has no news room or facilities of any kind or paid staff. Eberle is also President and CEO of GOPUSA. So close are the ties between GOPUSA and Talon News, that Eberle's GOPUSA contact information is listed as the administrative contact for Talon News. They are one entity. And they were credentialed by the White House. What caught everyone's attention was a question posed by "Gannon" to President Bush last month: "<i>Thank you. Senate Democratic leaders have painted a very bleak picture of the U.S. economy. Harry Reid was talking about soup lines. And Hillary Clinton was talking about the economy being on the verge of collapse. Yet in the same breath they say that Social Security is rock solid and there's no crisis there. How are you going to work -- you've said you are going to reach out to these people -- how are you going to work with people who seem to have divorced themselves from reality?</i>" </p>

<p>Interestingly, a lot of bloggers found the question suspicious and carried out investigations of their own, revealing Gannon for the fraud he is, and potentially revealing another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56330-2005Jan7.html"> mouthpiece of the administration posing as an independent journalist</a>. Gannon has since resigned his post at Talon News and admitted that he held White House press credentials under an alias. Now obviously there is an extensive background check on anyone applying for credentials, as James Pinkerton, a Fox commentator noted, saying "If [Gannon] was walking around the White House with a pass that had a different name on it than his real name, that's pretty remarkable." </p>

<p>Gannon/Guckert is also linked through the possession of a classified memo to the outing of CIA clandestine officer Valerie Plame, wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, once again hinting at very close ties to the more Rovian elements of the administration. The Talon News website is pretty paltry, and reminds me of the story of Stephen Glass, the former feature writer for The New Republic, fired after it was revealed he faked every story he ever wrote. Glass once created a poor mock-up of a website to try to give credibility to one of his faked stories. TalonNews.com is sort of posing in the same light.</p>

<p>Also interesting, and potentially overlooked by Bush's henchmen who found Guckert, is the fact that he owned several web addresses for what appears to be a side business as a gay male prostitute! He was found linked to hotmilitarystud.com, militaryescorts.com, militaryescortsm4m.com, among others. The man fought the blogs and the blogs won.</p>

<p>Is this finally a case of Bush's Nixon-like paranoia and need to seed the media biting him in the arse?  <img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/ender.gif"></p>

With Howard Dean's election to be chair of the Democratic National Committee, the party's slide into more-of-the-same obsolescence will come to a halt. Dean, an <br />
outspoken fiscally-disciplined social progressive is exactly what the party needs after years of centrist, appeasing, ambiguous party "leadership" (used loosely) enacting no strategies save for a controlled capitulation to the reactionaries. </p>

<p>In his first speech after being named Chair, Dean gave a preview of his vision: <br />
"Republicans wandered around in the political wilderness for 40 years before they took back Congress. But the reason that we lost control is because we forgot why we were entrusted with that control in the first place," Dean said in his acceptance speech.</p>

<p>"The American people cannot afford to wait for 40 more years for us to put Washington back to work for them. It won't take us that long -- not if we stand up for what we believe in, organize at the local level, and recognize that strength does not come from the consultants down. It comes from the grass roots up."</p>

<p>Republicans, Dean said, "know the America they want, and...are not afraid to use any means to get there. But there is something that this administration and the Republican Party are very afraid of -- it is that we may actually begin fighting for what we believe: fiscally responsible, socially progressive values for which Democrats have always stood and fought." </p>

<p>Dean also attacked Republicans' complete lack of fiscal discipline: "The Republicans introduced a $2.5 trillion budget that deliberately conceals the cost of their fiscal recklessness." A budget which, "brings Enron-style accounting to the nation's capital and it demonstrates once again what all Americans are now beginning to see: you cannot trust Republicans with your money."</p>

<p>"We believe that a lifetime of work earns you a retirement of dignity." <img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/ender.gif"></p>

            <p>Iraqi election results (major parties only):<blockquote><br />
United Iraqi Alliance (Shiite): 48%<br />
Kurdistan Alliance: 26%<br />
Iraqi List (Allawi's party): 14%<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>It appears that Shiite parties will have up to 140 seats in the new assembly, and Kurds 75 seats, out of a total 275 seats, completely changing the ruling landscape of Iraq. An important concern lingers, however, over just how religious the Grand Ayatollah Al-Sistani's United Iraqi Alliance party will be in governing. I sincerely hope we didn't just hand Iran a new fundamentalist Shiite ally. The only major secular Arab party, the Iraqi List, the party of Iyad Allawi, received only 14% of the vote. </p>

<p>From MSNBC:<br />
<blockquote><br />
"<i>When the Bush administration decided to invade Iraq two years ago this month, it envisioned a quick handover to handpicked allies in a secular government that would be the antithesis of Iran's theocracy ó potentially even a foil to Tehran's regional ambitions.</i><br />
 <br />
<i>But, in one of the greatest ironies of the U.S. intervention, Iraqis instead went to the polls and elected a government with a strong religious base ó and very close ties to the Islamic republic next door. It is the last thing the administration expected from its costly Iraq policy ó $300 billion and counting, U.S. and regional analysts say.</i></p>

<p>"<i>This is a government that will have very good relations with Iran. The Kurdish victory reinforces this conclusion. Talabani is very close to Tehran," said Juan Cole, a University of Michigan expert on Iraq. "In terms of regional geopolitics, this is not the outcome that the United States was hoping for.</i>" </p>

<p><i>Added Rami Khouri, Arab analyst and editor of Beirut's Daily Star, "The idea that the United States would get a quick, stable, prosperous, pro-American and pro-Israel Iraq has not happened. Most of the neoconservative assumptions about what would happen have proven false.</i>"  <img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/ender.gif"></blockquote></p>

So great was the ferocity of the attack -killing anywhere from 35,000 to 250,000 civilians- that Allied leaders, specifically British Prime Minister Winston Churchill distanced himself from the raid, saying to the British Chiefs of Staff the bombings were, "mere acts of terror and wanton destruction."</p>

<p>I came across an interesting BBC article about the rebuilding of Dresden, specifically that a British charity helped rebuild the city's cathedral. Another interesting echo of the raid is the nascent popularity in Saxony of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD), who've sought to redress "the one sided culture of victimhood" in Germany, with the bombing of Dresden and the death of German civilians as a focus. <img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/ender.gif"></p>
