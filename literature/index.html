        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>totally mentally ripped<br />
driving the streets in the afternoon<br />
stopping at signals<br />
looking at people walking on the sidewalks<br />
it's reality but a reality that has<br />
faded away.<br />
you know your judgement is<br />
warped but you don't give a<br />
damn.<br />
too long on earth, that's it,<br />
that's your problem.<br />
a story told too often.</p>

<p>the signal changes and you<br />
cross the avenue<br />
enter a side street<br />
drive along<br />
the houses are small and<br />
sad, have no heart.<br />
the asphalt boils under<br />
your wheels<br />
and there's no place to go,<br />
no surprise, no wonderment.</p>

<p>too long on earth, old dog,<br />
you are dirtied with life.</p>

<p>you circle back to the avenue,<br />
park behind a taco stand,<br />
get out, walk to the counter,<br />
wait.</p>

<p>a heavy girl approaches.<br />
she stands, looks at you.<br />
you pretend to be composed.<br />
coffee, you say, small, black.</p>

<p>she smiles at you.<br />
the smile says:<br />
i know you're crazy, but it's alright.</p>

<p>you get the coffee,<br />
take it back to the car.<br />
you are facing a dirty dark<br />
yellow wall.<br />
you sip the coffee:<br />
bitter horrible swill.</p>

<p>you drink half a cup, dump it out the window,<br />
back out of there<br />
and then you're driving west.</p>

<p>a psychiatrist wont help,<br />
a psychologist wont help,<br />
a god wont help.<br />
drinking's old and drugs make it worse.</p>

<p>you just drive in your car<br />
for a hundred years.<br />
for centuries.<br />
your head ripped<br />
rising up through<br />
the sunroof<br />
lolling on a long snake neck<br />
smiling a bloody smile,</p>

<p>paradise at last.</p>

            <p>I purchased a collection of Franz Kafka's short stories today for $4, and subsequently decided to post one of my old favorites below.</p>

<p>The Passenger</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand on the platform of the trolley car and am completely insecure about my footing in this world, in this city, in my family. Nor could I indicate even casually what demands I might rightfully make in any direction. In no way can I defend myself for standing on this platform, clutching this strap, letting this trolley carry me along, defend people for scurrying out of the way or walking quietly or window-shopping. Of course, no one is asking me for a defense, but that's beside the point.</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolley approaches a stop, a girl comes over to the steps, ready to get out. She is as obvious to me as if I had run my fingers over her. She is wearing black, the pleats of her skirt barely stir, her blouse is snug and has a collar of white, fine-meshed lace, her left hand is <br />
propped flat against the side of the trolley, the umbrella in her right hand is poised on the second step from the top. Her face is brown, her nose, slightly pinched on both sides, has a broad, round tip. She has a lot of brown hair and small stray hairs on her right temple. Her small ear lies close to her head, but by standing near her I can see the entire ridge of her right ear conch and the shadow at its root.</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered back then: How come she's not astonished at herself, how come she keeps her mouth shut and makes no remark?</i></p>

            <p>A passage I like from Hemingway's <i>Snows of Kilimanjaro</i>:</p>

<p>"<i>It was not her fault that when he went to her he was already over. How could a woman know that you meant nothing that you said; that you spoke only from habit and to be comfortable? After he no longer meant what he said, his lies were more successful with women than when he had told the truth.</i></p>

<p><i>It was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth to tell. He had his life and it was over and then he went on living it again with different people and more money, with the best of the same places, and some new ones.</i></p>

<p><i>You kept from thinking and it was all marvellous. You were equipped with good insides so that you did not go to pieces that way, the way most of them had, and you made an attitude that you cared nothing for the work you used to do, now that you could no longer do it.</i>"</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>I came across this passage from <i>A Rebours </i>(Against Nature) by Jori-Karl Huysmans and found the language so brilliant that I had to give a little tribute to it here:</p>

<p><i>'Des Esseintes's interest in the Latin language remained undiminished, now that it hung like a completely rotted corpse, its limbs falling off, dripping with pus, and preserving, in the total corruption of its body, barely a few firm parts, which the Christians took away to steep in the brine of their new idiom.</i></p>

<p><i>The second half of the fifth century had arrived, that horrifying period when the world was convulsed by appalling catacylsms. The Barbarians were ravaging Gaul; Rome, paralysed, sacked by the Visigoths, felt herself grow chill as her life ebbed away, and saw her distant limbs - the East and the West - thrashing about in blood and growing weaker day by day.</i></p>

<p><i>Amid the general dissolution, amid the assassinations of the Caesars that follow one another in quick succession, amid the uproar of the carnage that engulfs Europe from end to end, a terrifying hurrah rings out, stifling the clamour, silencing the voices. On the banks of the Danube thousands of men, wrapped in cloaks made from rat pelts and mounted on little horses - horrific-looking Tartars, with enormous heads, flat noses, chins furrowed by gashes and scars, and jaundiced, hairless faces - swoop down at lightning speed, enveloping in their whirlwind the provinces of the Lower Empire.</i></p>

<p><i>Everything vanished in the dust from those galloping horses, in the smoke from those fires. Darkness covered the earth and the nations trembled in consternation, as they listened to the dreadful whirlwind passing by with a thunderous roar. The horde of Huns razed Europe, hurled itself upon Gaul, and then broke apart on the plains of Chalons where Aetius routed it in a terrible charge. The plain, surfeited with blood, frothed like a sea of purple, two hundred thousand corpses blocked the way and broke the impetus of this avalanche, which, deflected, fell like an exploding thunderbolt upon Italy, where the devastated cities flamed up like hay-ricks.</i></p>

<p><i>The Western Empire crumbled under the impact, the failing life it was dragging out in imbecility and infamy was extinguished; the end of the universe seemed to be at hand; the cities forgotten by Attila were decimated by famine and by plague, and Latin in its turn appeared to be collapsing beneath the ruins of the world.</i></p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>I'd like to share a brilliant passage from Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i>:</p>

<p><i>Several months were ineffectually consumed in a treaty which was negotiated at the distance of three thousand miles between Paris and Antioch; and, as soon as Julian perceived that his moderate and respectful behaviour served only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary, he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of civil war. He gave a public and military audience to the quÊstor Leonas: the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the attentive multitude; and Julian protested, with the most flattering deference, that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus, if he could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation. The faint proposal was impetuously silenced; and the acclamations of "Julian Augustus, continue to reign, by the authority of the army, of the people, of the republic, which you have saved," thundered at once from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambassador of Constantius.</i></p>
