He was my candidate during the primaries this year so it goes without saying how excited I am to see him on the ticket with Obama. Here are some quotes from his speech last night that I thought were spot-on:<br /><br />"On the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain has been wrong and Barack Obama has been proven right." <br /><br />"My mother's creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you."<br /><br />"Even today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history,
nearly $500 billion in the last five years, John wants to give them
another $4 billion in tax breaks. That's not change. That's the same."<br /><br />"And when he says he'll continue to spend $10 billion a month, when the
Iraqis have a surplus of nearly $80 billion, that's not change. That's
more of the same."<br /><br />"Should you trust the judgment of John McCain, when he said only
three years ago, "Afghanistan, we don't read about it anymore in papers
because it succeeded"?<p> Or should you believe Barack Obama who said a year ago, "We need to send two more combat battalions to Afghanistan"?</p><p>
The fact of the matter is, al Qaeda and the Taliban, the people who
actually attacked us on 9/11, they've regrouped in the mountains
between Afghanistan and Pakistan and they are plotting new attacks. And
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has echoed Barack's call for
more troops.</p><p> John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was right."</p><p>"Folks, remember when the world used to trust us, when they looked to us
for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they'll look at us
again, they'll trust us again, and we'll be able to lead again."</p><br /> <div><br /></div>

<p>Manzikert was an important trading center in ancient Armenia, which at the time was a Byzantine vassal state. The Turks, recent immigrants from Central Asia, had begun moving into lands controlled by the Roman Empire and its successor in the East, the Byzantine Empire. The Turks had no interest in being good neighbors. Motivated by Islam, they ransacked Christian Armenia and eastern Asia Minor. </p>
<p>The Byzantines, for many years medieval Europe's most powerful and wealthy state, had become severely weakened by a series of utterly inept leaders with no military experience - and an addiction to civil strife and palace infighting.</p>
<p>Events came to fruition on a warm August day in 1071 - the Turks recently conquered the Armenian capital Ani and were poised to overrun Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Emperor Romanus Diogenes set off with an army of 70,000 towards the East. With him, as co-regent, was Andronikos Doukas, his chief (and quite bitter) rival. </p>
<p>As the battle began, the Turks approached in a crescent formation, attempting to draw the Byzantines into the center to be flanked on both sides by archers. The Byzantines held off the main attack and even succeeded to seize Sultan Alp Arslan's camp by the afternoon. The Turkish cavalry, however, in classic steppe form, was harassing Byzantine forces in hit and run attacks. The Emperor, realizing the exposure of his troops, ordered his forces to pull back into a more defensive posture. Doukas deliberately ignored the Emperor's command, effectively splitting the Byzantine force in two. The Turks saw the confusion and chaos among the Byzantine troops and pressed a full attack, breaking the lines and capturing Emperor Romanos Diogenes himself. Some portion of the Byzantine army managed to escape, including much of its leadership, save for Diogenes.</p>
<p>While Diogenes was in captivity, his rival Doukas, returned to Constantinople and proclaimed himself Emperor. </p>
<p>Examined&nbsp;in the greater historical context of constant civil strife, within 100 years the Turks had conquered, both ethnically and religiously, nearly all of Asia Minor. Doukas' legacy is best remembered as opening the door for the&nbsp;final destruction of Graeco-Roman civilization in Europe - as well as the forced conversion&nbsp;to Islam or&nbsp;explusion of Greeks from what is now known as Turkey.</p>
<p>Clinton faces a deep personal choice tonight. Does she throw the greater good aside in her pursuit of "the purple" or does she hold ranks and keep as one for the victory of a party rival?</p></p>

Like the dinner guest you never invited, Silvio Berlusconi has returned to office in Italy, his party winning a majority in the Italian government. Italy, as I have stated ad nauseum, is in desperate need of reform. Berlusconi is not the man for the job. While a wildly successful billionaire businessman, Berlusconi is best known in the political arena for his cafone-like outbursts that place Italy in diplomatic gaffes. Here are some of his "best" quotes:<br /><ul><li>
<font size="2">
"I am the Jesus Christ of politics. I am a patient victim, I put up with everyone, I sacrifice myself for everyone."</font></li><li><font size="2">
"I will try to meet your expectations, and I promise from now on,
two-and-a-half months of absolute sexual abstinence, until [election
day on] 9 April."</font></li><li><font size="2">(To German MEP Martin Schulz, at start of Italy's EU presidency in July 2003)<b>:</b>
<p>
"I know that in Italy there is a man producing a film on Nazi
concentration camps - I shall put you forward for the role of Kapo
(guard chosen from among the prisoners) - you would be perfect."</p></font></li><li><font size="2">
"Let's talk about football and women." (Turning to four-times-married
German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.) "Gerhard, why don't you start?"</font></li><li><font size="2">
"Italy is now a great country to invest in... today we have fewer
communists and those who are still there deny having been one. Another
reason to invest in Italy is that we have beautiful secretaries...
superb girls."</font></li><li><font size="2">
"Mussolini never killed anyone. Mussolini used to send people on vacation in internal </font>
<font size="2">exile."</font></li><li><font size="2"><p>
"We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that
has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and - in contrast
with Islamic countries - respect for religious and political rights, a
system that has as its value understanding of diversity and
tolerance... </p><p>
"The West will continue to conquer peoples, even if it means a
confrontation with another civilisation, Islam, firmly entrenched where
it was 1,400 years ago." </p></font></li><li>
<font size="2">

"There is no-one on the world stage who can compete with me."</font></li><li><font size="2">(On a proposal to base an EU food standards agency in Finland, rather than the Italian city of Parma):
<p>

"Parma is synonymous with good cuisine. The Finns don't even know what prosciutto is. I cannot accept this."</p></font></li></ul>Some interesting press headlines from major news outlets show just how unenthusiastic 
Berlusconi's re-election was:<br /><br />International Herald Tribune: <br /><h1 class="headline">Economy ailing, frustrated Italy picks Berlusconi</h1><br />
CNN:<br /><h1 class="headline">Italian Billionaire Berlusconi 'wins' election</h1>
<br />The Independent:<br /><h1 class="headline">Disillusioned Italians head to polls again</h1><br />Reuters:<br />
<h1 class="headline">Giving it to Berlusconi</h1><br />and lastly Reuters columnist Robin Pomeroy:<br /><h1 class="headline">"Irreplaceable" Berlusconi set to "save" Italy</h1><br />
Since Berlusconi spent much of his last run at PM pushing laws to give himself immunity from prosecution, perhaps he will have enough free time now to actually push through some changes. But most likely it will be the same old <i>merda</i>.<br /><br />(The text on the picture above is Italian for "beware of dog.")<br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            Amnesty International recently released a damming report on the death penalty worldwide for 2006 this week, noting that the U.S. has the ignoble seat at the table of the top six countries most frequently performing capital punishment.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are some key facts taken from Amnesty's report:<br /><ul><li>91 per cent of
all known executions took place in six countries: China, Iran,
Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan and the USA.</li><li>Some estimates say China executed at least 1,010 people, although Amnesty notes credible sources suggest
that between 7,500 to 8,000 were executed.</li><li>
Iran executed 177 people, <br /></li><li>Pakistan executed 82,</li><li>Iraq executed at least 65,<br /></li><li>Sudan executed at least 65, and<br /></li><li>There were 53 executions in 12 states in the USA.</li></ul>Given that no major study shows that the death penalty acts as a deterrent for crime, that all developed nations with the exceptions of South Korea and Singapore have all abolished the death penalty for this same reason - how is it we can proclaim ourselves leaders in all things humanitarian and still allow ourselves to sit in league with the most atrocious abusers of human rights on the planet? Lets separate logic from our sympathy for victims. What is the macro effect capital punishment is having on our society?<br /><br />Note: this is a continuing thread of death penalty coverage, for more, click below:<br /><br /><a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/2005/10/the-death-penalty-an-update.html">The death penalty - an update</a><br /><br /><a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/2004/12/romney-wouldbe-executioner.html">Romney - would-be executioner</a><br /><br /><a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/2004/11/canadas-embrace-of-progressive.html">Canada's embrace of progressives</a><br /><br /><a href="http://lastoftheromans.org/2003/01/kerry-massachusetts-is-your-st.html">Kerry, Massachusetts is your strength</a><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

Italian voters have two days at the polls to decide who should take the Prime Minister's job - Walter Veltroni, center-left candidate and former Mayor of Rome, or Silvio Berlusconi, center-right candidate, twice former Prime Minister and successful businessman. Berlusconi had two chances to improve Italy's lot and did little to nothing. Italy is the slowest growing major European economy and by most accounts was just passed by Spain in per capita income. This will be Italy's 63rd government since the end of World War II.</div><div><br /></div><div>The country needs major economic and political reforms for it to keep pace with the Eurozone.

Departing Prime Minister Romano Prodi (pictured above) was hailed as the right man for the job when he took office two years ago, however, his administration was plagued by in-fighting and fractures that ultimately unwound his governing coalition. Seats in Italy's Camera dei Deputati seem to award a disproportionate share to minority and fringe parties, forcing the larger ones to make "deals with the devil" in order to form a governing coalition. While at first glance it provides a more equal voice to all perspectives, it is entirely unpractical for proper governance.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Veltroni, some 20 years younger than Berlusconi, has taken cues from U.S. presidential candidate Barak Obama, even adopting his catch phrase, "Yes we can!"</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Ma può?</span></div>

            Anyone else notice how closely the national press follows polls? Not coincidentally, national coverage of the Iraq war has taken a back seat to the election and the economy, which seems to be a direct reflection of national polling[1]. <br /><br />It's commonly said that a good journalist constantly seeks to "afflict the comfortable" - that is to bring the most troubling issues of our time front and center to the least affected. While there are plenty of good journalists scouring the world reporting on some of the most horrid issues of our time, there is a terrible haze of disinterest amongst the American public for all things unpleasant. <br /><br />I don't propose this is anything new, but it seems to be more pronounced of late. <br /><br /><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/bush460.jpg" align="center"><br /><br />It all speaks to the cultural failure to assume personal responsibility. If you voted for Bush in 2000, or 2004, you are part responsible for this mess we're in in Iraq.<br /><br /><i>Dear American Public,<br /><br />Remember when you voted for Bush (at least once), and were cheerleading the Iraq invasion? What have you been up to lately? Ignoring casualty counts? Changing the channel when the coverage of Iraq starts? Yeah, look, you can't have it both ways. Sack up, admit you made a mistake, and learn your lesson to be skeptical of leadership like the founding fathers intended.<br /><br />Oh, and lose some weight you fat bastard.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Last of the Romans Management.<br /></i><br /><br />---<br />[1] http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm<br />

As much as we may gripe about the exclusion and single-mindedness of the American political parties, Italy is much the opposite. At current there are some 39 political parties holding seats in the Camera dei Deputati. They range from communists to xenophobes. Each government must set up delicate coalitions in order to create a governable majority. Prodi's was rooted in the center-left but involved communists. I believe his government was well intentioned but ultimately lacked the boldness needed to pass crucial reforms.<br><br>

Today Italy lags as the slowest growing member of the G8. According to some economists, Spain has now passed it in terms of GDP per capita. The south, not-so-affectionately referred to as the Mezzogiorno, is quite nearly another country; much poorer, much more rural, and with much more unemployment. Naples is awash in garbage; unions have refused to collect any additional trash because the Campanian dumps are overflowing. The EU is currently threatening Italy with penalties if it doesn't sort out the potential health disaster. Leadership is needed.<br><br>

What isn't needed, however, is a return of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. He's made remarks lately that indicate he wants to assume his old office a mere 20 months after being voted out. He spent the majority of his five year tenure making legal maneuvers to keep him from being prosecuted, neglecting the country's needed economic reforms. Italy today is one of the developed world's most heavily regulated economies.

Buona fortuna, Italia, you need it.

            I consider myself a pretty decisive person, but when it comes to this election I am having a hard time deciding among the candidates. I supported Joe Biden, the Democratic Senator from Delaware because I thought he had the best blend of pragmatism and experience. He didn't make it past Iowa and judging from the caucus results you'd wonder if he was even in Iowa. I suppose this election just catches me at a philosophical fork-in-the-road; I find myself becoming more and more alienated from the positions and behavior of the Democratic Party. Make no mistake, however, this doesn't also mean that I'm moving closer and closer to the Republican Party - trust me, far from that. I'm not sure where this puts me, personally it feels like I'm just moving off into the tall grass. <br><br>I've always been fiscally-oriented when it comes to politics; my personal perspective is that social issues should really be outside of the domain of legislators. Call me a Libertarian, but the Constitution didn't entrust Congress with the responsibility for deciding who can marry who or what type of family is best, or what religion I should subscribe to. I just want Congress to run the country and do it as efficiently as possible. That includes fixing Iraq, cutting waste and spending, and defending the borders and fixing immigration.<br><br>Currently there is no candidate that has any sort of record as a waste-cutter, who is detached enough from the party bases that could govern effectively, who would stick to matters of Government (and not personal matters), while at the same time improving our standing in the world and righting the federal budget.<br><br>It seems as well that this malaise that has paralyzed government extends to some extent to the state and local levels. I can tell you from experience that the near $5,000 a year I pay in property taxes seems to buy me only really expensive garbagemen and <a href="http://www.myrevere.net/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=5206&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1359&amp;hn=myrevere&amp;he=.net">police who get their cars stolen from in front of the police station</a>.

            Mitt Romney gave his anticipated speech today on his Mormon faith and how that plays into his run for president. Every media outlet has been comparing it with JFK’s famous 1960 speech about Catholicism. In fact they were wildly different speeches. Romney sought to cozy up to evangelicals while Kennedy sought to distance himself from influence from the Vatican. Compare these two quotes:<br><br>

Kennedy: “I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end; where all men and all churches are treated as equal; where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice…”<br><br>

Romney: “But in recent years, the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning. They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God. Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life. It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America – the religion of secularism. They are wrong. “<br><br>

Quite contrary to the spirit of the JFK speech, but the two were clearly catering to distinct interests.

            <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ome of the work I do for a living is information technology audits as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On a high level this involves assembling a picture of a publically-traded company's IT environment and then matching this up against a set of standards and best practices. We request documentation and evidence and perform testing. Some of our client engagements are on behalf of a company's internal audit department to get them ready for "attestation" by an accounting firm, and some of our engagements are coming in externally to do attestation work. A repeating pattern emerges from those managers or executives whose business units have little or no functioning internal controls, what I like to call the "Confuse & Distract strategy." In short, when you request something, say a screen-print of their company-wide group password settings, they provide you with 400 pages of company policies, print-offs and general nonsense. When normally it would take you a half hour to examine evidence provided as requested, it now takes you much longer to make sense of what you've been given.</p>

<p><img src="http://lastoftheromans.org/blather/archives/gen_hayden.jpg" hspace="4" align="left">Enter Air Force General Michael Hayden. The latest player in President Bush's Confuse & Distract Vaudeville act on true intelligence reform. While the circumstances surrounding outgoing CIA Director Porter-Goss's departure are questionable at best, he was at least a civilian. A lot of legislators, from both sides of the aisle, are finding the nomination of Gen. Hayden troublesome in light of the warantless wiretapping debackle. Nominating military brass, not exactly known for being forthcoming to this top intelligence post is nothing more than a distraction, meant to delay, diffuse, and obfuscate the push for intelligence reform. Why choose this path? Bush, with approval ratings ebbing to near-Nixon-during-Watergate levels certainly needs his Republican colleagues' support at this time, yet this decision leaves most of them confounded. Nominating a military general for this position seems a rather defensive tactic by the president; building walls in desperate times, insulating key agencies and key information. It represents another example of this president governing in politics not policy.</p>
